<p class='c012'>A P<span class='fsvs'>REFACE</span> to a book, is a sort of pedestal where the
author gets up to make a speech; frequently an apologizing
ground, where he “drops in—hopes he don’t intrude;” a
little strip of green carpet near the foot-lights, where he
bows to the audience, and with a trembling voice asks them
to look with lenient eyes on his darling bantling that is just
coming before the world. Very likely he tells of the numerous
difficulties and disadvantages under which he has
labored; perhaps apologizes for his style, under the plea of
writing against time, and that he has been greatly hurried.
Readers and critics are usually indulgent towards the minor
faults of an author, provided he entertains or instructs
them; but they pay little attention to special pleadings.
The writer who deliberately perpetrates a stupid or silly
book, deserves the fate of dunces—obloquy and contempt.
If he adds to this the double crime of setting up a justification,
and asks that his work be not subject to the usual
canons of criticism, then the reviewers should level their
heaviest guns, pepper him pungently, and prove him but a
buzzard, while he claimed the honors of a game-cock. We
however, have a right to expect and demand more from a
veteran author, than from a young and inexperienced one.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>The world is so perverse, so incorrigibly an unbeliever,
that very likely it would not credit a word of it—without
finding the statements proved—if the author of this little
volume were to say, that it was a readable and valuable
work, “just what has been wanted,”—a good thing, and in
season. Yet, gentle reader, “and still gentler purchaser,”
seeing you have paid your dollar!—it is most undoubtedly
true of the “Rambles” of this “Northurfari,” your humble
and obliged servant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dropping the εγω, he will tell you how it was. Spending
a few years in travel, he found himself after the “Great
Exhibition” epoch, like the unconquered and unconquerable
Macedonian, seeking for a world to pommel—with his
footsteps—and after diligent and long-continued search on
all the maps of all the Wylds, Johnstones, and Coltons in
Christendom, could find but one land that was untrodden;
but one that was not as contemptibly common as Irkoutsk,
Timbuctoo, or the Niger itself. I<span class='fsvs'>CELAND</span> was the shining
bit of glacier, the one piece of virgin ore, the solitary lump
of unlicked lava; and straightway to Iceland he went. It
might not interest his readers any, were they to be told
whether these pages were written in the saddle, or on Mount
Hekla; in a tar-painted house in Reykjavik, or in a marble
palace in London; on the deck of a Danish schooner, in a
continuous summer day of the Arctic sea, or by the light
of bright eyes in Scotia’s land. It so happens that the most
of them were penned in the U<span class='fsvs'>LTIMA</span> T<span class='fsvs'>HULE</span>, the <em>Terra Incognita</em>
which they attempt to describe; and very little has
been altered or amended since the original draft. The spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of travel is the freshest at the time the travel is enjoyed;
and all impressions are then the most vivid. What is written
on the spot, carries with it a <em>vraisemblance</em>; and, though
an after revision may add some polish to the style, yet to a
certain extent, it takes away the life and vivacity of the
narrative. This “polishing” and “editing” process, may
reduce it to a dead flat, and, like an attempt to smooth a
butterfly’s wing, remove the bloom, and leave it but a bony
shard. Slang may be bearable, though it can hardly be
creditable; puns may be so bad that some might call them
positively good; but dullness, and a style that is heavy to
stupidity, are the unpardonable sins of authorship. This
work, however, may have all, and more than all these
faults.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are no accessible books, of a late date, in our language,
that give either an intelligible or faithful account of
Iceland. The object of the following chapters has been to
present a readable and truthful narrative, to create some
interest in the people, the literature, and the productions of
the lonely isle of the north; and of the good or ill performance
of the task, the public must be the judges.</p>

<p class='c013'>H<span class='fsvs'>EIGHO</span>! for Iceland. The little schooner “S<span class='fsvs'>ÖLÖVEN</span>”
rides at anchor before Copenhagen. His Danish Majesty’s
mails are on board, and at 4 o’clock, A. M., July 1st, we are
set on deck. Yes; “we,” and a nice lot we are,—at least a
round dozen, and a cabin scarcely six feet square, with
only six berths and a sofa. “Every berth’s engaged,” said
the captain; “and you can’t go with us.” “Yes, but I can
though, if I sleep on deck.” So I ran my chance; and
when sleeping hours arrived, I was stretched out on a sort
of swing sofa in the middle of the cabin, suspended—like
Mahomet’s coffin—between floor and skylight. As it turned
out, though I took Hobson’s choice, I had altogether the
best berth in the ship; the most room, and the best ventilation.
So up the Cattegat we sailed, or rather down, for
the current runs north, towards the German ocean. The
S<span class='fsvs'>ÖLÖVEN</span>—Anglicé, <span class='fss'>SEA-LION</span>—is a capital sailer, and we
made good headway—the first day exactly sixteen miles;
and the next morning found us fast at anchor under the
guns of the far-famed castle of Elsinore. Nearly a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>vessels were in sight, wind-bound like ourselves. “There
goes a Yankee schooner!” says our skipper; and faith! right
in the teeth of the wind it dashed by, with the stars and
stripes flying. How the little fellow managed to get along,
is more than I know; but sail it did, and it was the only
craft in sight that was not at anchor. A fisherman came
alongside to sell some codfish he had just caught. He
asked a dollar and a half—nine marks, Danish—for about
a dozen. He and the captain were a long time pushing the
bargain, and finally Piscator concluded to take four marks—less
than half his first price.</p>

<p class='c013'>There’s no prospect of a fair wind, and most tantalizing
it is to be cooped up in our little craft, scarce a stone’s
throw from shore, and right in sight of gardens, fields,
streams, and waving trees. Signalling for a pilot-boat, we
soon had one along side. These water-ousels know their
trade, and by a combination among them no one stirs for
less than five dollars. The purse was soon made up, and we
had a day at Elsinore. Indeed I enjoyed it. Didn’t “come
from Wittenberg,” Horatio. No, but we came from Copenhagen.
Though but twenty-four hours on board, it was a
joyous sensation to touch the ground. A lot of people on
the quay; sailors of all nations, land-lubbers—like your
humble servant—merchants, pilots, idlers, and various other
specimens of the <em>genus homo</em>. One nut-brown looking
chap, with the round jacket and flowing trowsers that gave
the unmistakable stamp of his profession, rolling the quid
in his cheek, and looking at me, sings out, “Old England
forever!” “Yes,” says I, “and America a day longer.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Here, at Elsinore, are six or seven thousand people, who
subsist on contrary winds, shipwrecks, pilotage, and that
celebrated “toll”—a mere five-dollar bill, only—that all
vessels pay that trade in the Baltic. Danish vessels pay
nothing. If a foreign vessel passes here without paying, at
Copenhagen she has to pay double. This toll has been paid
for over 500 years; and for this consideration, I am informed,
the Danish government keep up the light-houses that guide
the mariner in and out of the Baltic. It is not as heavy as
the light-house fees of most other nations. This place is
sacred to Shakspeare, and Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, and
Ophelia, “the beautified Ophelia”—an “ill phrase” that, a
“vile phrase,” says old Polonius; and their names still live,
albeit their imperial persons,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—————“dead and turned to clay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All this the Danes seem to remember, for two splendid
steamers, the “H<span class='fsvs'>AMLET</span>” and the “O<span class='fsvs'>PHELIA</span>,” run regularly
between here and Copenhagen; and as if to disprove the
poet’s account, they run in unison with one another. We
soon found our way to the castle, about half a mile from
town, through a long, shady walk overhung with trees.
Somehow, when we read of the castle of Elsinore, and of
Bernardo and Francisco keeping sentry before it, and the
platform, and the ghost appearing there, it hardly seems as
if it was a real castle that we could now see and visit, and
climb over, and withal find sentries keeping guard over! But
here it is, and as substantial and real as that of Britain’s queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>at Windsor. I spent an hour on its lofty battlements. Here,
too, is the “ordnance,” such as the small-beer critics are
always abusing Shakspeare for having “shot off.” Yes, the
theater manager, actor, and dramatist, in his play of Hamlet,
adds to his text, “<em>ordnance shot off within</em>”—while these
small-fry scribblers cry out “anachronism.” Yes, they have
found out the wonderful fact that king Hamlet reigned here
about the year 1200, while gunpowder—“thy humane
discovery, Friar Bacon!”—was unknown for more than a
hundred years after. Go to: yes, go to Elsinore, and now
you’ll find ordnance enough to fire off, and blow up all the
paltry criticism that has been fired at Shakspeare since he
first lampooned Sir Thomas Lucy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The castle of Elsinore stands close beside the water, the
big guns sticking out directly over the Cattegat. On the
land side it is defended by bastions, cannon, moat, gates,
and draw-bridge. The castle covers, perhaps, two acres of
ground, inclosing a hollow square or court yard in the center.
It is unlike any other castellated pile I have ever seen.
At the corners are towers of different heights; the tallest
one is about 175 feet high, and looks like a pile of Dutch
cheeses, the largest at the bottom. The party I was with
were all Danes; and, though their language is cousin-German
to our Anglo-Saxon, and I could in part understand it,
as if “native and to the manor born,” yet I preferred my
own. With another party was a very pretty and intelligent
German girl, who spoke English, and was acquainted with
the place; and to her I was indebted for the best <em>vivâ voce</em>
account that I had. We were first taken into the chapel, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>small and very neat place of worship in the south-east angle
of the castle. The glaring and rather gaudy style of the
coats of arms of the royal and noble families whose dead
are here, gave it something of a gingerbread appearance;
but otherwise I liked it. I looked in vain for a monument
to Mr. Shakspeare’s hero. Could I have found that skull
of Yorick, “the king’s jester,” I think I should have carried
it off as a sacred relic, and made a present of it to Ned
Forrest. Alas! no Yorick, no Hamlet, no Polonius—not
one of their “pictures in little,” nor even a slab to their
memory, could I see. We ascended one of the corner towers—used
as a light-house and observatory, and provided
with telescopes—from whence we had a fine view of the
Cattegat, the island of Zeeland, and the lofty range of
Swedish mountains on the opposite coast. Directly across
the strait, some three miles distant, is the Swedish town of
Helsingborg, a place about the size of Elsinore. The prominent
object in it is a tall square tower, probably the steeple
of a church. In one room of the castle, where I could
fancy the “melancholy Dane” in his “inky cloak,” the
Queen, with “her husband’s brother,” and Rosencrantz and
Guildernstern, and old blear-eyed Polonius, too, there was a
broad fire-place, with the mantel-piece supported by caryatidæ
on each side. When some of our scenic artists are
painting “a room in the castle” of Elsinore, for a scene in
Hamlet, if they have no better guide, they may remember
the above slight description, if they please. Any traveler
visiting Elsinore, will find this room in the northeast corner
of the castle, and on the second or third floor. We walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>out on the ramparts, and saw a few soldiers: wonder if any
of them have the name of Bernardo or Francisco! The men
on guard were lolling lazily about, not walking back and
forth like English or American sentries. The smooth-mown
embankments, the well-mounted guns, and the “ball-piled
pyramid,” with the neat appearance of the soldiers, showed
the good condition in which the castle is kept. No marks
of ruin or decay are visible. I tried to find some musket
bullet, or something besides a mere pebble, that I could take
away as a souvenir, but I could get nothing. A woman
was in attendance in the chapel, but no one accompanied us
about the castle; no gratuities were asked, no “guides”
proffered their obsequious services; but I believe the German
party knew the locality, for we found “open sesame” on
every latch. I thanked the fair German for her explanation;
and we walked to town, back, through the avenue of
trees. At four we went to a hotel, and had a capital dinner.
I then strolled about the place, looked at the “sights”—all
there were to be found—went to a book-store and a toy-shop,
and bought some prints and some little porcelain
dolls.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very merry day I’ve had at Elsinore, on the firm earth;
and now for the rocking ship. Yes, a pleasant day we’ve
had, but perhaps we shall pay for it hereafter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our voyage through the Cattegat had all the delay and
uncertainty that ever attends these waters. Strong currents
and light and contrary winds make the passage slow;
but it is usually far easier coming out than going into the
Baltic. In a few days we were north of the German ocean,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>beating along the Norway coast with a northwest wind.
We passed for two days near the land, and had a good view
of the bold mountain scenery northwest of Christiansand.
Long piles of mountains, reaching often clear to the water’s
edge, showed a poor country for cultivation. The most distant
were covered with snow, but the nearest were all of that
deep brown tint that reveals a scanty vegetation. Sometimes
the strip of green meadow land near the water had a
house on it here and there; and once or twice villages of
twenty or thirty buildings were seen, all built of wood, and
covered with red tiles. We saw none of those famous forests
of Norway pine, where the ship timber grows, and
which English ship-builders tell you is “from the Baltic.”
These must be in the interior. On the fourth of July I was
determined to have some fun. The captain had two small
cannon on board, and I asked him if I might have some
powder to wake up my patriotism. Yes, he was quite
willing. I produced some of the good things needful, lemons,
sugar, et cetera, and told the captain to mix a monster
bowl of punch. He was good at it; the punch was capital,
and was soon smoking on the table. Our cannon were iron
pieces, not quite heavy enough to knock down the walls of
Badajos, but still of size sufficient for our purpose. They
were mounted on each side of the vessel, and revolved on
swivels. The powder was furnished, and we <em>banged</em> away,
waking up the echoes of liberty from all the Norwegian
mountains. I have no doubt but the pilots along the shore
were considerably astonished. Now, says the captain, we
want the oration. So up I jumped to the top of the boom, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>in about nine minutes and a quarter, gave them the whole
account of the cause, the means, and the manner of Brother
Jonathan “lickin’ the Britishers.” The captain translated
it for the benefit of the Danish and Icelandic passengers,
and they applauded both the orator and translator. The
punch was glorious, the oration was undoubtedly a grand
one, the cannon spoke up their loudest; and altogether, for a
celebration got up by one live Yankee, it probably has never
been surpassed since Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga. It
was a most beautiful evening, and very pleasing to think
that at that very hour millions of my countrymen, far far
away over the plains and valleys of my native land, were
enjoying the festivities of a day, the events of which will
be remembered till time shall be no more.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather was pleasant for some days, and we were
gradually wafted towards the northwest. Vessels bound to
the southwest of Iceland, from Denmark, generally sail near
Fair Isle, passing between the Shetlands and the Orkneys.
We were carried much further north, the ninth day finding
us near the lofty cliffs of the Faroes. I thought after
getting past the parallel of 60° north, in the latitude of
Greenland, that the weather would be perceptibly colder;
and probably it would with the wind constantly from the
west or northwest; but with a southwest breeze we had
mild, pleasant, summer weather. Sea-birds, particularly
gulls, were our constant companions, and while near the
Faroe Isles they came about us in immense numbers. One
day one of these lubberly children of the ocean tumbled
down on the deck, and to save his life he couldn’t rise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>again. He was on an exploring expedition, and I’ve no
doubt he learned something. He didn’t seem to admire the
arrangements about our ship very much, and altogether he
seemed out of his element. We had one or two confounded
ugly women on board, and I don’t think he liked the looks
of them very much. I pitied his case, and raising him up
in the air, he took wing and soared away. No doubt he
will ever retain pleasant recollections of his Yankee acquaintance,
one of a race, who, enjoying their own liberty,
greatly like to see others enjoy it too. We had a fine view
of the magnificent cliffs of the Faroe Isles, some of them
nearly three thousand feet high. They are basaltic, and
often columnar, looking much like the cliffs about the Giant’s
Causeway and Fingal’s Cave at Staffa, but far higher.</p>

<p class='c013'>We continued our course to the westward, lost sight of
land, and for some days were floating on a smooth sea, with
very little wind. How destitute of shipping is the Northern
ocean! For near two weeks we did not see a sail.
Whales frequently came near the vessel, blowing water from
their spout like a jet from a fountain. In my travels by sea
I had never seen a whale before, and I looked on their gambols
with much interest. The sight of them very naturally
called up the words of the good old New-England hymn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ye monsters of the bubbling deep,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Your Maker’s praises spout;</div>
      <div class='line'>Up from the sands ye codlings peep,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And wag your tails about.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It must be understood that I’m fond of quotations, particularly
poetry; and all must admit that this is a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>appropriate one. Why couldn’t good old Cotton Mather,
or some of his compeers, have given us some more of this
sort? Perhaps he did, but if so, my memory has not
recorded them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The noise of a whale spouting can be heard from one to
two miles. He throws the water from thirty to fifty feet
high. The whale rises clear to the surface of the water,
gives one “blow” and instantly goes under. He generally
rises again in one or two minutes, but is sometimes under
five minutes. Once as I sat on the bowsprit watching two
or three that were playing about, one swam nearly under
me, rose up, blew a blast with his water-trumpet, giving me
quite a sprinkling, and then sank. I had a good opportunity
to see him, and got a fair view of his breathing pipe.
It was a round hole in the top of his head, had a slight rim
round it, and I should think was about two inches and a
half in diameter. This animal, as near as I could judge,
was between sixty and seventy feet in length. The top of
his head and shoulders was broad and flat, and near or
quite twelve feet across. His back, instead of appearing
round, was nearly level, and showed room enough for a
quartette of Highlanders to have danced a reel thereon.
’Twould have been a rather slippery floor though, and I
think a dancer would have needed nails in his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Loud sung out the captain one day, and looking over
the side, close to the ship, deep under the clear water, we
saw a shark. O! it makes me feel savage to see one of
these monsters, I want to cut out his heart’s blood. Many a
good Christian do these villains swallow. The captain told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>us that one Christmas day when he was in the Pacific, a
shark came near, and a large hook baited with a piece of
pork was thrown into the water; he instantly seized it, and
they hauled the monster up the ship’s side, and an officer
on board drew his sword and cut him nearly in two, before
he was allowed on deck. Each passenger took some part
of him as a trophy of their Christmas-day fishing.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had a few books on board, and did the best I could to
make the time pass agreeably. But with all our resources,
literary, ornithological, piscatorial, and miscellaneous, there
were many dull hours. One calm day I got out my writing
materials, and thought I would write a letter, or a chapter
of these wanderings. After getting fairly engaged, a sudden
shower seemed to dash over me; and looking up, a sailor
“high on the giddy mast,” while painting the yard had
upset his paint pot, and down the white shower came on my
hat, coat, paper and every thing around. We must take
things coolly on shipboard, as well as elsewhere, I suppose;
for there is no use in getting vexed, whatever may
chance. As for the letter, I sent that to its destination,
with all its imperfections on its head. I scraped the paint
off my hat, and the mate and I set to work to clean my
coat. After scrubbing it an hour or two, we fastened a rope
to it, and throwing it overboard, let it drag in the sea a few
hours. The soapsuds and old Neptune together took nearly
all the paint out, but it never entirely recovered from the
effects of the shower from the mainmast. As for books, I
left England with the very smallest amount of luggage possible,
restricting myself in the reading line, to my small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Bible, Sir George Mackenzie’s Travels in Iceland, and one
or two more. At Copenhagen, I purchased six or eight
volumes of Leipsic reprints of English works—what the
publisher calls “Tauchnitz’s edition of standard English
authors;” some of them are English works, but by what
rule of nationality he reckons among his <em>English</em> authors
the works of C<span class='fsvs'>OOPER</span> and I<span class='fsvs'>RVING</span>, I do not know. Among
the volumes I purchased, were some from Shakspeare,
Byron, Scott, Dickens, and Bulwer. I found my reading,
as I knew I should, quite too scanty. I would have given
something for <em>Diodorus Siculus</em>, and good old <em>Froissart</em>;
two books that it would take a pretty long sea-voyage to
get through.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among our passengers were two or three of the dignitaries
of Iceland; one Sysselman, and the landfoged or
treasurer of the island, William Finsen, Esq. On leaving
London I took two or three late American papers with me;
and in one of them, the “Literary World,” there was by
chance, a notice of a late meeting of the Society of
Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen. Among the names
of distinguished persons present, there were mentioned
some Danes, some Englishmen, and “some Americans,”
and among the latter, William Finsen Esq. of Iceland!
I showed this to Mr. Treasurer Finsen, and he was greatly
amused to learn that he was a Yankee. We had among
our passengers several ladies—one, a Miss Johnson, a
very pretty, intelligent, modest-appearing Iceland lassie,
who had finished her education at Copenhagen, and was
returning to her native land to establish a female school.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The domestic animals on board, were one large, curly-haired,
black dog, who rejoiced in the name of “Neeger,” and four
rather youthful swine, who were confined, or rather were
pretended to be confined, in a box. The first day out they
leaped the barriers of their stye, and made a dinner on the
slender contents of several flower pots that the lady passengers
were taking out to cheer the windows of their
parlors in their Iceland homes. The discovery of the
depredation was any thing but pleasant, and I believe had
the “prices of stock” been taken at that time, live pork
would have been quoted as falling, and if not clear down,
would have been decided to be, on that ship, a thorough
bore. Though they went the “whole hog”—the entire
animal in the floral line—that day, they did not sleep or
feast on roses all the voyage. They did not like their
quarters overmuch, and would usually manage at least once
a day, to get out and go on an exploring expedition round
the deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our living on board was, I believe, as it usually is on
Danish merchant vessels. It consisted principally of a thin,
watery compound called “soup,” of black potatoes, black
beef, and yet blacker bread. At the evening meal we had
for drink, hot water frightened into a faint color by a gentle
infusion of China’s favorite plant. This drink our captain
called “tea.” Believing that good order on shipboard is
much promoted by subordination and submission to the
commanding officer, I never used to tell him it wasn’t
“tea.” If strength, however, is a sign of life, I must say
that this showed very little sign of vitality. It probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>contained at least half a teaspoonful of tea, to a gallon of
water; but Oh! that black bread! it was not so bad an
article, though, after all. We had one blacker thing on
board, and that was our dog “Nigger.” The good boys
and girls in America, who eat “Indian bread,” “wheat
bread,” “short cake” and “johnny cake,” have all read of
the peasants of Europe living on “black bread,” and
wonder what it is. It is made of rye, ground, but not
bolted much, if any; and the bread is very dark, a good deal
darker than corn bread. At first I did not like it very
well, and at Elsinore I purchased a couple of large wheaten
loaves. This bread is very dear: I paid half a dollar a
loaf; these lasted me about ten days, but before that time,
the mould had struck clear through them. Not so the
black bread. That keeps much better than wheaten bread.
The mould walks into it gradually however, but thoroughly.
At first there appeared a green coat, on the side that stood
next to another loaf in baking. This coat of mould kept
growing deeper and deeper, getting first the eighth of an
inch, then a quarter of an inch, and before the end of the
voyage, over half an inch deep of solid green. Inside of
this the loaf was moist and fresh; and certainly, after getting
used to it, it is very good bread. It was the “staff of life”
with us; and considerably like a <em>staff</em> the loaves were, being
in size and appearance about like a couple of feet of scantling
cut out of the heart of an oak. So much for living on
shipboard. If we did not fare like princes, we had the
consolation of knowing that the fares we paid were very
light. So bad fare and light fares went together; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>made it all fair. On the fifteenth day out, we first saw the
coast of Iceland. It was an irregular, rocky promontory,
ending in Cape Reykianess, the southwestern extremity of
the island. In two days we saw and passed the “Meal
sack,”—(Danish <em>Meel sakken</em>)—a singular rock island
about eight miles southwest of Cape Reykianess. While
passing I took a drawing of it, and certainly very much
like a bag of meal it looks. It is near 200 feet high, and
about that in diameter, apparently perpendicular all round;
on the north a little more so! All over its craggy sides,
we could see thousands of sea-birds. As sunset approached
we saw great numbers of gannets flying towards it, going
to rest for the night. This bird, known as the solan
goose, is larger than a goose, and while flying, from its
peculiar color has a most singular appearance. They are
white, except the outer half of the wing, the feet, and the
bill, which are jet black, and the head a sort of brownish
yellow. A word more about these birds, and some others,
hereafter. Southwest of the Meal sack a few miles, is
another singular island called “the Grenadier.” It is a
most striking looking object, standing up out of the ocean
several hundred feet high, like some tall giant or lofty
pillar. What a constant screaming of sea fowl there is at
all times about these lonely islands! But where is the
night in this northern latitude, in the summer season? Ask
the lovely twilight that continues for the two or three hours
that the sun is below the horizon. At midnight I read a
chapter in the Bible, in fine print, with perfect ease. At
a distance of several miles I could tell the dividing line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>between the rocks and the vegetation on the mountains.
And what a splendid panorama of mountain scenery this
singular country presents! Unlike any thing that I have
ever seen on the face of the globe. Finally on the nineteenth
day of our voyage, our little bark dropped anchor in
the harbor of Reykjavik, and our cannon announced to the
Icelanders the arrival of the “Post ship” with letters and
friends from Denmark. Then with expectation about to be
gratified, I stepped ashore on the rocky coast of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>A<span class='fsvs'>ND</span> this is Iceland!—but I see no ice. This is the island
that is shown to us in our geographical books and maps, as
a small white spot on the borders of the Arctic ocean, and
described as a cold, dreary, and uninteresting region, inhabited
by a few dwarfish and ignorant people, who have
little knowledge of the world, and of whom little is known.
The names of one or two of its mountains are given, and
some place is mentioned as its capital or largest town.
That the country itself, or any thing that is to be found here,
is worth a journey to see, or that the history or habits of
the people possesses any degree of interest, has not, probably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>crossed the minds of a thousand persons. There is,
however, a vague tradition, and some persons actually believe
that the Icelanders or some other people from among
the northern nations, once sailed to the American shores,
prior to the voyages of Columbus. What may be the
prominent characteristics of this U<span class='fsvs'>LTIMA</span> T<span class='fsvs'>HULE</span>—this farthest
land—what its productions are, how extensive the
country, how numerous the population, and how the people
live, there have been few means of knowing. But Iceland
is not a myth, it is actual and real, a solid portion of the
earth’s surface. It is not, either, what every one supposes,
nor what we have reason to believe it is, from its name, its
location, and the meager descriptions we have had of it.
But it has not been thought advisable to leave this country
entirely alone, especially in an age of travel and discovery
like the present. The Yankee is here; his feet tread its
heath-clad hills and snow-covered mountains. He has
boiled his dinner in the hot-springs, cooled his punch in
snow a hundred years old, and toasted his shins by a volcanic
fire. But a “chiel” may come and take his notes:
every thing of interest, past events and present existing
things, can not be seen by one pair of eyes. Let us draw
a little from the manuscripts of the Iceland historians. We
can find as reliable and as permanent records of this people,
and their early voyages and discoveries, as we have of the
voyages of Columbus, the warlike achievements of William
the Conqueror, or the campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte.
These records are the “Sagas” or historical writings of
the Icelanders, written soon after the events transpired; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>they are now in existence in the public libraries of Iceland
and Denmark. Some of these are in Latin, some in the old
Norse, and some in Icelandic; and duplicates of some of
the more important have been made by publishing them in
<em>facsimile</em>, just as they stand on the original parchment.
The most important of these record with a good deal of
minuteness the “Ante-Columbian discovery of America.”
Some account of the early history of this singular people,
and particularly a notice of the early voyages of the Northmen,
which I gathered from historical records here in Iceland,
and from the Icelanders themselves while traveling
through the land, will be of interest before speaking of the
present appearance of the country.</p>

<p class='c013'>Iceland was first discovered by Naddod, a Norwegian
pirate, in the year 860, almost one thousand years ago. He
was thrown on the coast in the winter, and from the appearance
of the country, he called it Snæland, or “Snow-land.”
Four years after, Gardar Swarfarson, a Swede, circumnavigating
it, found it an island, and named it “Gardar’s
Holm” or Gardar’s Isle. His account of the country
was so favorable, that Floki, another sea-rover, went there
to settle; but neglecting to cut hay in the summer, his cattle
perished in the winter. From the vast accumulations of ice
on the west coast, ice that was driven over from Greenland,
he called the country <em>Iceland</em>, a name it has ever since
borne. In 874, the first permanent settlement was made in
Iceland, by Ingolf a Norwegian chieftain. Greenland was
discovered in 980, one hundred and twenty years after the
discovery of Iceland. In 982, Eric surnamed the Red, sailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to Greenland, and, in 986, established a settlement there
which flourished for more than four hundred years. To induce
settlers to go and reside in the new country, the most
fabulous accounts were given of the climate and productions.
The face of the country was represented as clothed in green,
and it was even stated that “every plant dropped butter.”
The name of <em>Greenland</em> thus given to it, was as great a
misnomer as <em>Iceland</em> applied to the neighboring isle. In reality,
the two countries should change names for Iceland is
a country of green fields and fair flowers, while Greenland is
covered with almost perpetual ice and snow. Eric the Red
had a companion in his Greenland settlement, whose name
was Heriulf. Biarni, the son of Heriulf, sailed from Iceland
to join his father in Greenland, was driven south, and landed
on the American coast—probably Labrador. Thus, the first
discovery of America by Europeans was in the year 986, by
Biarni Heriulfson, a native of Norway, though he sailed
from Iceland. He returned north, landed in Greenland, and
gave an account of his discovery. Subsequent voyages to
the American coast, were made by Leif and his two
brothers, sons of Eric the Red, who after the style of
names in Iceland were called Ericsson. I am speaking on
good authority in saying that a gifted Swede, now an
American citizen, and most prominent before the world, is
a direct descendant of Eric and his son. I allude to Captain
Ericsson, the inventor of the Caloric ship, a pioneer in
American discovery, and a worthy descendant of the Ericssons,
pioneers in the discovery of America. Another
interesting fact may be noted. Among the early settlers in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>America—for a settlement was formed, that continued several
years—some of the men had their wives with them. One
of these, the wife of Thorfin, while in America, gave birth
to a son, who was named Snorre. This Snorre Thorfinson,
was the first native-born American of whom we have any
account, and may be set down as the first Yankee on
record. From this Thorfinson was descended Thorwaldsen,
and also Finn Magnusen the historian and antiquary, so
that we can almost claim the great sculptor of the North
and the great historian, as Americans. These facts I
gathered from Icelandic genealogical tables; and all who
have investigated the history of the northern nations, know
with what accuracy these tables are compiled. To return
a little in my narrative. Leif Ericsson having purchased
the ship of Biarni Heriulfson, sailed from Greenland in the
year 1000. The first land he made he called <em>Helluland</em>, or
“land of broad flat stones.” This was doubtless the coast
of Newfoundland. The next coast he saw was covered
with forest, and consequently he named it <em>Markland</em>, or
“Woodland.” This was probably Nova Scotia. The next
land he discovered, still farther south, produced vines and
grapes, and this he named “V<span class='fsvs'>INLAND</span>,” a name the Icelanders
ever afterwards used in speaking of the American
Continent. We have the best of proof in their account of
the climate and productions, in the length of the days, as
well as in their maps and drawings, that their settlement
was on some part of our New-England coast, probably
Massachusetts or Rhode Island. In subsequent voyages,
these adventurous navigators sailed farther south; and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>supposed from the account they gave, that they proceeded
as far as Virginia and the Carolinas. Timber, furs and
grapes, were the most valuable articles the country produced;
and for these, several voyages were made to Vinland,
from Greenland, houses were built, and settlers resided in
the country for at least three years; from 1011 to 1014.
In their intercourse with the Indians, the Iceland and
Greenland adventurers carried on their business about after
the same political code that Raleigh, John Smith, and
others, did afterwards. They first traded with the Indians,
then fought them. They sold them red cloth in strips the
width of a finger’s length, and in return, received their furs
and skins. As their cloth grew scarce, they cut the strips
narrower; and finding they could buy just as many skins
for a strip an inch wide, as if it was four inches, they cut it
narrower and narrower, till they got it down to a finger’s
breadth. The Indians bound it about their heads, and were
greatly delighted with its ornamental appearance. Finally
the red cloth grew scarce, and then the Indians gave their
furs for soup and other eatables; and thus,—to use the
words of an Iceland historian, they “carried off their bargains
in their bellies.” In the first skirmish that occurred
in the new settlement, the Northmen seemed to get the
worst of it, and fled towards their boats, when Freydisa,
daughter of Eric the Red, and wife of Thorvard, caught up
a spear and turned on the Indians, reproaching her countrymen
for their cowardice. By her heroic example, the
Indians were defeated, so we find that the successful issue of
the first battle between Europeans and North American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Indians, was owing to the courage of a woman. Voyages
continued to be made to America, from both Greenland and
Iceland, to as late a period as the middle of the fourteenth
century. The last trip of which we have any record, is that
of a vessel sent from Greenland to Markland (Nova Scotia)
for timber and other articles. While returning, it encountered
heavy storms, and was driven into port in the west of
Iceland. The old Greenland settlements continued for a
long period, the latest account we possess, coming down to
the year 1484. When they perished, or from what cause,
is unknown. Remains of churches and other buildings are
found there to this day. We now come to one of the
most significant facts connected with the discovery of the
American continent. It is doubly proved in the records of
that period, <span class='fsvs'>THAT</span> C<span class='fsvs'>OLUMBUS</span> S<span class='fsvs'>AILED TO</span> I<span class='fsvs'>CELAND</span>, <span class='fsvs'>IN THE</span>
Y<span class='fsvs'>EAR</span> 1477. An account of this is given by the Iceland
historians, and published in the “Antiquitates Americanæ.”
It is also recorded by Columbus himself, in a work of his
“on the five habitable zones of the earth.” In this book,
which is now extremely rare, he says, in the month of
February, 1477, he visited Iceland, “where the sea was not
at that time covered with ice, and which had been resorted
to by many traders from Bristol.” It will be remembered
that John and Sebastian Cabot were both from Bristol.
Humboldt, in his “Cosmos,” speaks of this voyage of
Columbus to Iceland, and of the record of it made by the
great navigator himself in his work on the zones. Humboldt
also speaks at considerable length of the early voyages
of the Icelanders and Greenlanders to America; and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>all these events he speaks as he does of other well-established
historical facts. So let us hear no more of the
“vague tradition,” the mere “thought” or “belief,” that
America was known to the early navigators of the north.
Let it be spoken of as one of the well-known, and clearly
authenticated historical facts in the history of the world.
It takes nothing from the merits and reputation of Columbus.
And what if it did? The reader of history is a
seeker after truth, and most certainly the writer of history
should be. During the visit of Columbus to Iceland, he
might have conversed in Latin with the bishop of Skalholt,
or other learned Icelanders, on the subject of the early
voyages of the Northmen to America, but this does not
seem at all probable. Had this been the case, some record
or mention of it would probably have been made, either in
the writings of Columbus or of contemporary historians.
Then, too, in his early struggles to obtain material aid to
prosecute his geographical researches, he omitted no facts
or arguments that would be likely to convince the kings
and queens whom he applied to, that his theory of the
earth was correct, and that land would be found by sailing
to the west. His first voyage, too, was for the purpose of
finding China or the Indies, and not in the direction of the
Vinland of the Northmen. When he discovered land, he
believed it to be some part of the East Indies; and, to the
day of his death, Columbus never knew that he was the
discoverer of a new continent. One of the oldest of the
sagas or historical documents from which the facts were
gathered respecting the early discovery and settlement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>America, was the saga of Eric the Red. The statements in
this and other historical papers, are corroborated in old
Iceland geographies, and also by some European writers,
particularly by Adam of Bremen, a theological writer,
nephew of Canute, King of England. He says that while
he was in the north, propagating Christianity, Swein Ethrithson,
King of Denmark, gave him an account of these
discoveries. This was about the year 1070.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we trace the history of Iceland from its first settlement
to the present time, we shall find that the intelligence,
activity, prosperity, and happiness of the people, and the
rise and progress of the arts and sciences among them, has
been exactly proportioned to the liberal and republican
spirit of their government. For fifty-four years—from the
first settlement of Iceland, in 874, to the year 928—it was
a Norwegian colony, governed by chiefs. As the population
increased, and the infant settlement waxed strong, difficulties
arose between the rulers and the ruled; and finally
the people threw off their allegiance, framed a constitution,
and set up a republican government, which continued for
333 years. The close of this era was in the year 1261.
All the native historians agree in calling this the Golden
Age of Iceland. During this period Greenland was discovered
and settled, the continent of America was discovered,
and an enterprising, daring, and successful series
of voyages was carried on, that eclipsed the efforts of all
previous navigators. Christianity was established and bishops
appointed both in Iceland and Greenland, poetry and
history were cultivated, and a degree of intellectual activity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was shown, beyond that of any country in the north of Europe.
Thrown on their own resources, in a cold and dreary
climate, the same causes operated in raising up a vigorous,
moral, and intellectual people, that was shown in the history
of our own Pilgrim Fathers. It was during this
period that the most valuable and important sagas were
prepared and written; papers that show the successful
enterprise of the northern voyagers. “The wonderfully
organized free state of Iceland maintained its independence
for three centuries and a half, until civil freedom was annihilated,
and the country became subject to Hakon VI. King
of Norway. The flower of Icelandic literature, its historical
records, and the collection of the sagas and eddas, appertain
to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> During
these two centuries, their poets—skalds or minstrels—visited
nearly every court in Europe, and composed and
sung their lyrical productions. They were attached to the
suites of kings and princes, attended warriors to the battle
field, and celebrated the exploits of their employers in
undying verse. Instances are recorded, where a king has
died, that his praises were sung so ably by his minstrel
that he was installed in his place, and filled the vacant
throne. In the Iceland republic the chief officer was
called the “L<span class='fsvs'>AUGMAN</span>,” or administrator of the laws. He
was elected by universal suffrage. Their national assembly
or congress was known as the “A<span class='fsvs'>LTHING</span>,” and had both
legislative and judiciary powers. The members were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>elected by ballot, and when they met formed but one body,
the president, or laugman, presiding over their deliberations.
They assembled in the open air at a place called
Thingvalla, and large numbers of the people gathered
round them as spectators. I walked over the ground,
where this primitive congress had met for nearly a thousand
years. It is a raised circle of earth, shaped like an
amphitheater, and now overgrown with grass. On one
side was a mound, a little higher than the rest, where the
president sat. Though the powers of the Althing were
greatly abridged at the fall of the republic, yet they have
continued to meet in this house, without a roof, until the
year 1800. At that time the Althing was removed to
Reykjavik, and has ever since met in a building. Their sessions
are annual, and always held in the summer. At the
end of each session, a journal of their proceedings and reports
of the debates are published in a volume. The Icelanders
have ever regretted, and with good reason, the
removal of their congressional meetings from the primitive
location of Thingvalla, to the town of Reykjavik, where
they are surrounded by dissipation and the corrupting
influence of foreign merchants. The scene at Thingvalla,
at the time of my visit, July, 1852, was solitary, quiet, and
peaceful. Oxen, sheep, and horses, were grazing on every
side; and the mower was whetting his scythe and cutting
the grass where legislators and grave judges had assembled
and made laws for the people. The scenery is grand and
picturesque. It is directly before the Thingvalla lake, the
largest in Iceland, and surrounded, on the north and east,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>by lofty mountains. Thingvalla has thus been the legislative
capital of Iceland, until its final removal to Reykjavik,
in the year 1800; though Skalholt—once the location of
a church and a bishop’s see, though now nothing but a
farm—is erroneously given as the capital, in the most of
our books of geography.</p>

<p class='c013'>Foes within, not enemies without, overthrew the Iceland
republic. A corrupt body of chiefs and rulers sold
it to Norway, in the year 1261; and, one hundred and
nineteen years afterwards—in 1380—it was, with that
power, transferred to Denmark; and under the government
of that country it has ever since remained. Until about
the year 1490, their maritime trade was open to all nations,
and vessels of every flag were allowed to take cargoes to
Iceland. After that, for three hundred years, the commerce
of the country was either held by the Danish crown or
farmed out to merchants and traders, and often to foreign
companies. The only rule of action in letting out the trade
of the country seemed to be, to dispose of it to the highest
bidder. The most of these companies oppressed and starved
the poor Icelanders into compliance with the most rigorous
and exacting measures. As the country produced neither
grain, fruit, coal, nor wood, they were dependent on commerce
with foreign countries for all the luxuries and many
of the necessaries of life. Trade being taken entirely out
of the hands of the Icelanders, they necessarily grew dis-spirited;
their ambition was crushed, and, though ardently
attached to their country, they could but mourn over their
unhappy lot. Since 1788, commercial affairs have been on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>but little better footing, the trade being entirely in the
hands of the Danish merchants, but not farmed out to a
company. The trade, foreign and domestic, is open to both
Danes and Icelanders, but to no others. No foreign vessels
are allowed to visit Iceland for purposes of traffic, unless
they carry coal or timber, or go with cash to buy the products
of the country. As there are no merchants but
Danes in all the commercial towns, foreign traders would
never find purchasers for their cargoes of timber or coal
were they to go there.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this time the legislative powers of Iceland are vested
in the Althing, and presided over by the governor, who is
called the Stifftamptman. This body is composed of twenty-six
members, one from each county or syssel—twenty in
number, elected by ballot—and six appointed by the king.
All the members of the Althing must be residents of the
country, but they may be either Danes or Icelanders.
When an act is passed by a majority, it must be sent to
Copenhagen for the approval of the king, and if not signed
by him does not become a law. The Icelanders very naturally
desire “free trade,” and wish to have their ports
thrown open to the competition of the world; but the
Danish merchants and ship-owners in Iceland and Denmark,
enjoying as they now do, a monopoly of the commerce,
are all opposed to this. In the session of 1851, the
king’s councillors—the six he appointed—prepared a bill,
and introduced it, allowing foreign vessels to trade here,
but with the proviso that they should pay a tonnage duty
of about one rix-dollar per ton. The trade of Iceland being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>neither extensive nor lucrative, this would amount to just
about a complete prohibition. The other members nearly
all opposed the bill, saying, “Give us free trade or nothing;”
and it never passed the house. The governor was incensed
to see the will of his royal master thwarted; and like some
governors in our old colonial times, he dissolved the Althing,
and they broke up in a grand row. It was adjourned
over for two years, to meet again in 1853. The friends of
free and unrestricted trade, in Iceland, are in hopes of having
a law passed before many years, opening their ports to
the ships of all nations alike. The “Stifftamptman” or
governor is appointed by the king, and holds his office during
the pleasure of His Majesty. He is usually a Danish
nobleman, and receives a salary of 3,000 rix-dollars a year,
which is paid by the Danish government. There are three
amptmen or deputy governors, residing in the northern,
southern, and eastern quarters of the island. The Stifftamptman,
residing in the west, renders a fourth amptman
unnecessary. The governor presides at all sessions of the
Althing, manages all state affairs, presides over the post-office
department, and carrying the mails, and is in every
respect the head of the state, without a cabinet or advisers.
There is a treasurer—or landfoged, as he is termed—who
is also appointed by the crown, and receives a salary of
2,000 rix-dollars a year. The public funds are kept in an
iron chest in the governor’s house, under the protection of
a double lock and two keys, one of which is kept by the
governor and the other by the treasurer. Both of these
are necessary to open the chest. The principal officer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>each county, or syssel, is called the sysselman, and is elected
by the people. The sysselman is both sheriff and magistrate;
and all suits at law in his syssel are tried before him,
an appeal being allowed to the Supreme Court at Reykjavik.
The Supreme Court is presided over by the chief justice,
who is appointed by the crown, and holds his office permanently.
The sysselman, in their respective syssels, call all public
meetings, convene elections, and preserve order. In the
useful arts, so far as their productions and circumstances
will allow, and in moral and religious improvement, Iceland
has kept pace with the world. Printing was introduced in
the year 1530; and the Reformation, which had been going
on in Europe for some time, extended to Iceland in 1551.
The Roman Catholic Church at this time, the established
religion of the country, had become so corrupt, that the
last Catholic bishop and his two illegitimate sons were beheaded
for murder and other crimes. Since then to the
present day, the religion of the country has been Lutheran,
and there is said to be not one person residing in Iceland
except Protestants. Such is a slight sketch of the settlement
and progress of this isolated country.</p>

<p class='c013'>T<span class='fsvs'>HE</span> geographical features of Iceland, and the manners
and customs of the people, are no less interesting than the
history of the nation. Iceland lies just south of the polar
circle, between sixty-three and a half and sixty-six and a half
north latitude, and between thirteen and twenty-four degrees
west longitude from Greenwich. Its length from east
to west, is about two hundred and eighty miles, and
its average width one hundred and fifty. In extent of surface
it is nearly as large as the State of New-York, containing
not far from forty thousand square miles. It is three
hundred miles east of the coast of Greenland, a little over
five hundred from the north of Scotland, nearly one thousand
from Liverpool, thirteen hundred from Copenhagen,
and about three thousand miles from Boston. The coast
is deeply indented with bays, its valleys are drained by large
rivers, and every part abounds more or less with lofty mountains.
Though volcanic regions have many features in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>common, Iceland differs greatly from every country in the
known world. It presents a greater array of remarkable natural
phenomena than can be found throughout the whole extent
of Europe and America. To the naturalist and the man
of science, to the geologist, the botanist, and the ornithologist,
it is probably less known than any equal tract of accessible
country in the world. The burning chimnies of Ætna, Vesuvius,
and Stromboli, have given inspiration to Horace and
Virgil, and been minutely described by the pens of Strabo,
Diodorus Siculus, and Pliny. Not so the region of Hekla
and Skaptar Jokull. In the Mediterranean states, art and
nature can both be studied; in Iceland, nature alone, but
nature in her wildest moods. But how will those mountains
in the south compare with these in the north? All
the volcanoes in the Mediterranean would scarcely extend
over more ground than a single county in the State of New
York, while Iceland is one entire volcanic creation as large
as the State itself. Though not active all at once, yet
throughout the length and breadth of the land may be
found smoking mountains, burning sulphur mines, hot
springs that will boil an egg, and jets of blowing steam
that keep up a roar like the whistle of a gigantic steam engine.
The volcanic region of Iceland may be set down as
covering an area of sixty thousand square miles; for volcanoes
have repeatedly risen up from the sea near the coast,
and sometimes as far as seventy miles from land. Though
Ætna is higher than any mountain in Iceland, and of such
enormous bulk that it is computed to be 180 miles in circumference;
yet if Skaptar Jokull were hollowed out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Ætna and Vesuvius both could be put into the cavity and
not fill it!</p>

<p class='c013'>Iceland, too, is classic ground. Not, however, in the
same sense that Italy, Sicily, and Greece, are. The hundred
different kinds of verse now existing in many volumes
of Iceland poetry, the sagas, and other literary productions
of the Icelanders, have not been read and re-read, translated
and re-translated, like the works of Herodotus, Xenophon,
Tacitus, and Cicero, and for very good reasons. The country
is not one of such antiquity; it is not a country renowned
for arts and arms, and overflowing with a numerous
population. As a state, it is nearly destitute of works of
art, and its scanty population can only procure the bare
necessaries of life. Scarcely a page of Icelandic literature
ever put on an English dress and found its way among the
Anglo-Saxons, until the pen that gave us Waverley and
Rob Roy, furnished us with a translation of some of the
more important of the Iceland sagas. The author of the
“Psalm of Life” and “Hyperion” has given us some elegant
translations of Iceland poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>On stepping ashore in Iceland, the total absence of trees
and forests, and the astonishing purity of the atmosphere,
strike the spectator as among the more remarkable characteristics
of the country. The fields are beautifully green:
the mountains, clothed in purple heath, appear so near that
you are almost tempted to reach forth your hands to touch
their sides. At fifteen or twenty miles distance, they appear
but three or four; and at seventy or eighty miles, they
seem within ten or fifteen. Such is the effect of the magical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>purity of the atmosphere. In other countries you go and
visit cities and ruins; here you see nature in her most fantastic
forms. In other states you pay a shilling, a franc, or
a piastre, for a warm bath in a vat of marble; here you
bathe in a spring of any desired temperature, or plunge into
a cool lake, and swim to the region of a hot spring in the
bottom, guided by the steam on the surface. In other
lands you step into marble palaces that are lined with gold
and precious stones, and find hereditary legislators making
laws to keep the people in subjection; here you see a grass-grown
amphitheater where an elective congress met and
legislated in the open air for nearly a thousand years. In
other and more favored climes, you find comfortable houses,
and “fruits of fragrance blush on every tree;” here, not a
fruit, save one small and tasteless berry, and not a single variety
of grain, will ripen, and their houses are mere huts of
lava and turf, looking as green as the meadows and pastures.
In other lands, coal and wood fires enliven every hearth,
and mines of iron, lead, copper, silver, and gold, reward the
labor of the delver; but here, not a particle of coal, not one
single mineral of value, and not one stick of wood larger
than a walking-cane can be found. Many of the mountains
are clad in eternal snows, and some pour out rivers of fire
several times every century. But, though sterile the soil
and scanty the productions, our knowledge of the country
must be limited if we consider it barren of historical facts and
literary reminiscences. A country like this, nearly as large
as England, must possess few agricultural and commercial resources,
to have at this time, nearly one thousand years after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>its first settlement, a population of only sixty thousand souls.
Yet the Icelanders, while laboring under great disadvantages,
are more contented, moral, and religious, possess
greater attachment to country, are less given to crime and
altercation, and show greater hospitality and kindness to
strangers, than any other people the sun shines upon. Their
contentment and immunity from crime and offense, do not
arise from sluggishness and indolence of character; nor are
they noted alone for their negative virtues. They possess a
greater spirit of historical research and literary inquiry,
have more scholars, poets, and learned men, than can be
found among an equal population on the face of the globe.
Some of their linguists speak and write a greater number of
languages than those that I have ever met in any other
country. Iceland has given birth to a Thorwaldsen, a sculptor
whose name will descend to the latest posterity. His
parents were Icelanders, but he was a child of the sea, born
on the ocean, between Iceland and Denmark. Among their
poets and historians will be found the names of Snorro Sturleson,
Sæmund, surnamed F<span class='fsvs'>RODE</span>, or “<span class='fss'>THE LEARNED</span>,” Jon
Thorlaksen, Finn Magnusen, Stephensen, Egilson, Hallgrimson,
Thorarensen, Grondal, Sigurder Peterssen; and these,
with many others, will adorn the pages of Icelandic literature
as long as the snow covers their mountains, and the
heather blooms in their valleys. Their navigators and merchants
discovered and settled America long before Genoa
gave birth to a Columbus, and while Europe was yet immured
in the darkness of the middle ages. The works of
their poets and literary men have been translated into nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>every language in Europe; and they in their turn have translated
into their own beautiful language more or less of the
writings of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Young, Byron, Burns,
Klopstock, Martin Luther, Lamartine, Benjamin Franklin,
Washington Irving, and many others. In the interior of
the country a native clergyman presented me a volume—an
Iceland annual, the “N<span class='fsvs'>ORTHURFARI</span>,” for 1848&ndash;9—that
contains, among many original articles, the “Story of the
Whistle,” by Dr. Franklin; a chapter from Irving’s “Life of
Columbus;” translations from Dryden; Byron’s “Ode on
Waterloo;” Burns’ “Bruce’s Address;” Kossuth’s Prayer on
the defeat of his army in Hungary; part of one of President
Taylor’s Messages to Congress; and extracts from the
N<span class='fsvs'>EW</span> Y<span class='fsvs'>ORK</span> H<span class='fsvs'>ERALD</span>, the L<span class='fsvs'>ONDON</span> T<span class='fsvs'>IMES</span>, and other publications.
With scarcely a hope of fame, the intellectual labors
of the Icelanders have been prosecuted from an ardent thirst
of literary pursuits. Personal emolument, or the applause
of the world, could scarcely have had a place among their
incentives to exertion. As an example we need only notice
the labors of Jon Thorlakson. This literary neophyte, immured
in a mud hut in the north of Iceland, subsisting on
his scanty salary as a clergyman, which amounted to less
than thirty dollars a year, together with his own labors as a
farmer, yet found time during the long evenings of an Iceland
winter, to translate into Icelandic verse, the whole
of Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” Pope’s “Essay on Man,” and
Klopstock’s “Messiah,” besides writing several volumes of
original poetry. Throughout their literary and political
writings can be seen that spirit of republicanism, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>ardent love of political liberty, which always characterizes
a thinking and intellectual people. Interspersed with their
own sentiments expressed in their own tongue, will be seen
quotations from other writers, and in other languages.
With Dryden they say,</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Such is the literary and republican spirit of this toiling and
intellectual people.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Icelanders live principally by farming and fishing.
They take cod and haddock, from five to forty miles out to
sea. Whales often visit their harbors and bays, and are
surrounded by boats and captured. Their season for sea-fishing
is from the first of February to the middle of May.
In the summer they catch large quantities of trout and salmon
in their streams and lakes. They have no agricultural
productions of much value, except grass. Grain is not cultivated,
and their gardens are very small, only producing a
few roots and vegetables. The climate of the country is
not what we would suppose from its location. Columbus,
who was there in February, tells us he found no ice on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>sea. It is not as cold in winter as in the northern States of
America, the thermometer seldom showing a greater degree
of severity than from twelve to eighteen <em>above</em> zero. In
summer, from June to September, it is delightfully mild and
pleasant, neither cold nor hot. The cold season does not
usually commence until November or December; and sometimes
during the entire winter there is but little snow, and
not frost enough to bridge their lakes and streams with ice.
In summer, fires are not needed, and the climate during
this season is more agreeable than that of Great Britain or
the United States, having neither the chilly dampness of
the one, nor the fierce heat of the other. Thunder-storms
in Iceland occur in the winter, but not in the summer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their domestic animals are sheep, cattle, horses, and
dogs. They rarely keep domestic fowls, but from the nests
of the wild eider-duck they obtain large quantities of eggs,
as well as down. Reindeer run wild in the interior, but are
not domesticated. Blue and white foxes are common; and
these, with eagles, hawks, and ravens, destroy many of their
sheep and lambs. White bears are not found in the country,
except as an “imported” article, when they float over from
Greenland on the drift ice. The domestic animals in Iceland
are estimated in the following numbers:—500,000
sheep, 60,000 horses, and 40,000 cattle. All their animals
are of rather small size, as compared to those in more temperate
regions. Their horses are a size larger than the ponies
of Shetland, and average from twelve to thirteen hands
high. Their hay is a short growth, but a very sweet, excellent
quality. The Icelanders speak of their “forests,”—mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>bunches of shrubbery from two to six feet high. These are
principally birch and willow. The beautiful heath, so common
in Scotland and the north of Europe, is found throughout
Iceland. Their game birds are the ptarmigan, the
curlew, the plover, and the tern. Nearly every variety of water-fowl
common to Great Britain or America, abounds in the
bays, islands, and shores of Iceland, and in the greatest numbers.
The Icelanders export wool, about 1,000,000 lbs. annually,
and from two to three hundred thousand pairs each of
woolen stockings and mittens. Besides these articles, they
sell dried and salted codfish, smoked salmon, fish and seal
oil, whale blubber, seal and fox skins, feathers, eider-down,
beef and mutton, hides, tallow, and sulphur. They import
their principal luxuries—flour, rye and barley meal, beans,
potatoes, wine, brandy, rum, ale and beer, tobacco, coffee,
sugar, tea, salt, timber, coal, iron, cutlery, fish-hooks and
lines, cotton and silk goods, leather, crockery, and furniture.
From thirty to forty vessels sail from Denmark to Iceland
every year. Reykjavik, the capital, on the west coast, is the
largest town in the island—a place of about 1,200 people.
Then there are Eskifiorth and Vopnafiorth in the east,
Akreyri in the north, and Stykkisholm and Hafnarfiorth
in the west, all places of considerable trade. All goods are
taken to Iceland duty free; and letters and papers are carried
there in government vessels, free of postage, and sent
through the island by government messengers. By the
present arrangement, the government “post-ship” makes
five voyages to and from Iceland in a year. It sails from
Copenhagen to Reykjavik on the first days of March, May,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>July, and October, and from Liverpool to Reykjavik on the
first day of January. It leaves Reykjavik, for Copenhagen,
February 1st, April 1st, June 1st, and August 10th; and
from Reykjavik for Liverpool on the 10th of November.
One half of the trips each way, it stops at the Faroe Isles.
In addition to the mail service by this ship, letter-bags are
forwarded from Denmark by the different vessels trading
to Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>All travel and transportation of goods and the mail
through the interior of Iceland is on horseback. There’s
not a carriage-road, a wheeled vehicle, a steam-engine, a
post-office, a custom-house, a police officer, a fort, a soldier,
or a lawyer in the whole country. Goods, dried fish, and
valuables are left out of doors, unguarded, with impunity,
stealing being almost unknown. There never was but one
prison in the island, and that was used also as an almshouse.
Even then it was nearly useless, and most always without a
tenant; and finally, to put it to some use, it was converted
into a residence for the Governor, and is now the “White
House” in the capital of Iceland. Taxes are very light,
and do not amount to as much as the expense of carrying
on the government, paying the officers, and transporting the
mail. The Icelanders are universally educated to that extent
that all can read and write. There is but one school
or institution of learning in the country—the college at
Reykjavik. This has a president and eight professors, and
usually from eighty to a hundred students. The boys educated
here are nearly all trained for clergymen, or else to
fill some of the civil offices in the island, or they expect to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>go abroad, or live in Denmark. This institution is endowed
by the Danish government, and was formerly at Bessastath,
a few miles south of Reykjavik, whence it was removed
a few years since. The president is Bjarni Johnson, Esq.,
a native Icelander, a gentleman of rare accomplishments
and learning, and one of the first linguists in Europe. The
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Danish, French and English languages
are taught here, as well as most of the sciences. It
was during college vacation when I was in the country, and
I used to meet in the interior, at their fathers’ houses, young
men who were students of the college, and who could converse
fluently in Latin, Danish, French, or English. The
Bible or Testament, and usually many other books, particularly
historical and poetical works, are found in nearly every
house in Iceland. The population being scanty, with the
great majority of the people it is impracticable to have
schools, so that education is confined to the family circle.
During their long winter evenings, while both males and
females are engaged in domestic labors, spinning, weaving,
or knitting—by turns one will take a book, some history,
biography, or the Bible, and read aloud. The length of
their winter nights can be appreciated when we consider
that the sun in December is above the horizon but three or
four hours. Before and after Christmas he rises, sleepily,
at about ten o’clock, and retires between one and two in the
afternoon. This is quite different from the earlier habits
and longer visits of that very respectable luminary in more
temperate and tropical climes. True, he makes atonement
in the summer, when he keeps his eye open and surveys the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>land daily from twenty to twenty-one hours. Then he rises
between one and two o’clock in the morning, looks abroad
over a sleeping world, and only retires behind the mountains
at near eleven o’clock at night.</p>

<p class='c013'>While traveling in the country, I used frequently to ask
the children in poor families to read to me in Icelandic, and
I never saw one above the age of nine years that could not
read in a masterly style. Their writing, too, is almost invariably
of great elegance. This is partly owing to their
practice of multiplying copies in manuscript, of almost all
the historical and poetical works written in the country,
copying them in advance of their publication, and often afterwards.
The manners and customs of the people have
changed with the progress of time and the change in their
form of government. In old times we are told, that when
the Icelanders or Norwegians were about setting out on any
expedition of importance they used to have a grand feast.
At these banquets, horse-flesh was one of their luxuries.
Bards and minstrels would recite poems composed for the
occasion; and story, song, and hilarity, added zest to the entertainment.
After eating, drinking, and singing, to a
pretty high degree of elevation, they would close the proceedings
by throwing the bones at one another across the
tables! We are not informed, however, that the modern
Icelanders indulge in these luxuries. Their trade is gone,
and they are now a simple, pastoral people. In complexion
the Icelanders resemble the Anglo-Saxon race, often having
florid and handsome countenances. They are fine figures,
frequently tall, several that I have seen being over six feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in height. Light hair most usually prevails, but I have
seen some that was quite dark. In a large district in the
northwest of Iceland, all the men wear their beards, a practice
that has been in vogue for hundreds of years. They
always seem pleased when a stranger appears among them
who has adopted a fashion so much in accordance with their
own philosophy, with nature, and the laws of health, and at
the same time that adds so much to the personal appearance
of the lords of creation.</p>

<p class='c013'>W<span class='fsvs'>E</span> landed at Reykjavik at six o’clock in the morning.
Though the sun was near five hours high, scarce a person
was up. At this season the sun evidently rises too early for
them. Sleep must be had, though, whether darkness comes
or not. Reykjavik with its 1,200 people, for a capital city,
does not make an extensive show. The main street runs
parallel with the low gravelly beach, with but few houses
on the side next the water. In one respect this is a singular-looking
place. Nearly all the houses are black. They
are principally wooden buildings, one story high, and covered
with a coat of tar instead of paint. Sometimes they
use tar mixed with clay. The tar at first is dark red, but in
a little time it becomes black. They lay it on thick, and it
preserves the wood wonderfully. I walked through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>lonely streets, and was struck with the appearance of taste
and comfort in the modest-looking dwellings. Lace curtains,
and frequently crimson ones in addition, and pots of
flowers—geraniums, roses, fuchsias, &amp;c.—were in nearly
every window. The white painted sash contrasted strongly
with the dark, tar-colored wood. After hearing a good deal
of the poverty of the Icelanders, and their few resources, I
am surprised to find the place look so comfortable and
pleasant. The merchant usually has his store and house
under one roof. The cathedral is a neat, substantial church
edifice, built of brick, and surmounted by a steeple. This,
with the college, three stories high, the hotel, a two-story
building with a square roof running up to a peak, and
the governor’s house, a long, low, white-washed edifice built
of lava, are the largest buildings in Reykjavik. Directly
back of the town is a small fresh-water lake, about a mile
in length. What surprises me most is the luxuriance of
the vegetation. Potatoes several feet high, and in blossom,
and fine-looking turnips, and beds of lettuce, appear in most
all the gardens. In the governor’s garden I see a very
flourishing-looking tree, trained against the south side of a
wall. This is not quite large enough for a main-mast to a
man-of-war, but still it might make a tolerable cane, that
is, provided it was straight. It is about five feet high, and
is, perhaps, the largest tree in Iceland. Certainly it is the
largest I have yet seen. The temperature, now, in midsummer,
is completely delicious. The people I am highly
pleased with, so far as I have seen them. There is an agreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>frankness about them, and a hearty hospitality, not to
be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have just had a ride of six or seven miles into the
country, to Hafnarfiorth. Professor Johnson, the President
of the College, accompanied me. We rode the small
pony horses of the country, and they took us over the
ground at a rapid rate. The country is rough, and a great
part of it hereabouts covered with rocks of lava. We
passed one farm and farm-house where the meadows were
beautifully green, strongly contrasting with the black, desolate
appearance of the lava-covered hills. One tract was all
rocks, without a particle of earth or vegetation in sight.
The lava had once flowed over the ground, then it cooled
and broke up into large masses, often leaving deep seams
or cracks, some of them so wide that it took a pretty smart
leap of the pony to plant himself safe on the other side. At
one place where the seam in the lava was some twenty feet
across, there was an arch of rock forming a complete natural
bridge over the chasm. The road led directly across
this. We passed near Bessasstath, for many years the seat
of the Iceland college. Near this, Prof. Johnson showed
me his birth-place. The house where he was born was a
hut of lava, covered with turf, and probably about as splendid
a mansion as those where Jackson and Clay first saw the
light. Suddenly, almost directly under us, as we were
among the lava rocks, the village of Hafnarfiorth appeared.
This is a little sea-port town of some twenty or thirty
houses, extending in a single street nearly round the harbor.
We called on a Mr. Johnson, a namesake of my companion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and were very hospitably entertained. The table was soon
covered with luxuries, and after partaking of some of the
good things, and an hour’s conversation, we had our horses
brought to the door. Our host was a Dane, a resident merchant
of the place, and he had a very pretty and intelligent
wife. They gave me a pressing invitation to call on them
again, the which I promised to do—whenever I should go
that way again! I returned the compliment, and I believe
with sincerity on my part. That is, I told them I should
be very happy to have them call at my house when they
could make it convenient. Now, some of the uncharitable
may be disposed to say that all this ceremony on my part
was quite useless. True, I lived thousands of miles from
the residence of my entertainers, that is, if I may be said
to “live” anywhere; and, being a bachelor, I had no house
of my own, nor never had; but if I had a house, and Mr.
and Mrs. Johnson would call on me, I should be very glad
to see them!</p>

<p class='c013'>I should mention that Prof. Johnson speaks English
fluently; mine host, not a word; neither could I speak
much Danish; but with the learned professor between us,
as interpreter, we got along very well. A violent rain had
fallen, while we were coming; but it cleared up, and we
had a pleasant ride back to Reykjavik, arriving about
eleven o’clock, a little after sunset.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a few days at the capital, I prepared for a journey
to the interior. A traveler can take “the first train” for
the Geysers, if he chooses; but that train will hardly go
forty miles an hour. It is only seventy miles; but if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>gets over that ground in two days, he will do well. There’s
plenty of steam and hot water here, and “high pressure”
enough; but you may look a long while for locomotives;
or—if I may perpetrate a bad pun—any motives but local
ones, in the whole country. Roads—except mere bridle
paths—or vehicles of any kind, as I have mentioned, are
unknown in Iceland. All travel is on horseback. Immense
numbers of horses are raised in the country, and they are
exceedingly cheap. As for traveling on foot, even short
journeys, no one ever thinks of it. The roads are so bad
for walking and generally so good for riding, that shoe-leather,
to say nothing of fatigue, would cost nearly as
much as horseflesh. Their horses are certainly elegant,
hardy little animals. A stranger in traveling must always
have “a guide;” and if he goes equipped for a journey, and
wishes to make good speed, he must have six or eight horses;
one each for himself and the guide, and one or two for the
baggage; and then as many relay horses. When one set
of horses are tired, the saddles are taken off and changed
to the others. The relay horses are tied together, and
either led or driven; and this is the time they rest. A
tent is carried, unless a traveler chooses to take his chance
for lodgings. Such a thing as a hotel is not found in Iceland,
out of the capital. He must take his provisions with
him, as he will be able to get little on his route except
milk; sometimes a piece of beef, or a saddle of mutton or
venison, and some fresh-water fish. The luggage is carried
in packing trunks that are made for the purpose, and fastened
to a rude sort of frame that serves as a pack-saddle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Under this, broad pieces of turf are placed to prevent galling
the horse’s back. I prepared for a journey of some
weeks in the interior, and ordered my stores accordingly.
I had packed up bread, cheese, a boiled ham, Bologna sausages,
some tea and sugar, a few bottles of wine, and something
a little stronger! I had company on my first day’s
journey, going as far as Thingvalla. There was a regular
caravan; about a dozen gentlemen, two guides, and some
twenty horses. My “suite” consisted of guide, four horses,
and a big dog, Nero by name, but by the way a far more
respectable fellow, in his sphere, than was his namesake
the old emperor. Our cavalcade was not quite as large as
the one that annually makes a pilgrimage to Mecca, but a
pretty good one for Iceland. We had with us, Captain
Laborde, commander of the French war frigate now lying
in the harbor, and several of his officers; Mr. Johnson,
president of the college, and some of the Reykjavik merchants.
Nationally speaking, we had a rather motley
assemblage, albeit they were all of one color. There were
French, Danes, and natives; and—towering above the
crowd (all but one confounded long Icelander)—mounted
on a milk-white charger eleven hands high, was one live
Yankee! We were to rendezvous in the morning on the
public square, and be ready to start at seven o’clock. Notwithstanding
great complaints that travelers sometimes
make of the slowness of Iceland servants, we were ready
and off at half past seven. On we went, at a high speed,
for Thingvalla is a long day’s journey from Reykjavik.
The Iceland ponies are up to most any weight. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>one “whopper” of a fellow in our company, mounted on a
snug-built little gray that seemed to make very light of
him. Indeed ’twas fun to see them go. The animal for
speed and strength was a rare one; the rider, not quite a
Daniel Lambert:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But, for fat on the ribs, no Leicestershire bullock was rounder;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He galloped, he walloped, and he flew like a sixty-four pounder.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>No etiquette touching precedence on the road. You can
go ahead and run by them all, provided your pony is swift
enough, but if not, you can go behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>To all appearance, an Iceland landscape does not come
up, in point of fertility, to the Genesee country or the Carse
of Gowrie. “Magnificent forests,” “fields of waving grain,”
and all that, may exist in western New York, in old Virginia,
or in California; but not in Iceland. We passed,
during the first five miles, one or two farms with their
green meadows; then, mile after mile of lava and rock-covered
fields. Was the reader ever in the town of De
Kalb, St. Lawrence county, New York? That fertile and
beautiful grazing country, where the sheep have their noses
filed off to a point, so that they can get them between the
rocks, to crop the grass! That paradise of the birds, where
the crows carry a sack of corn with them while journeying
over the country, lest they starve on the way, and tumble
headlong on the plain! That delightful region will give a
little, a very slight idea of some part of Iceland. By the
way, that old town in New York, methinks, is quite rightly
named. The name was given it in honor of that Polish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>nobleman who poured out his blood and yielded up his life
on the field of Camden, in the sacred cause of American
liberty. Brave Baron De Kalb! Green waves the pine—I
once trod the turf—where thou did’st fall. We treasure
thy name and title, and endeavor to remember thy virtues,
by calling a town after thee—<em>barren De Kalb</em>!</p>

<p class='c013'>In speaking of rocks in Iceland, it will be borne in
mind that every mineral substance here is volcanic—lava,
pumice, trap, basalt, jasper, obsidian, &amp;c. The whole
island is undoubtedly one entire volcanic creation, produced
by a submarine eruption. In the whole country there has
never been seen a particle of granite, limestone, mineral
coal, iron or precious metal, or any of the primitive formation
of rocks. The lava is most all of a dark color, usually
brown; some of the very old is quite red, and the new very
black. It is scattered about, piled up in heaps, regular and
irregular, and of every imaginable shape and form. About
a mile and a half from Reykjavik is a large pleasant valley
of green grass. This is a common pasture for all the cows
and some of the horses that are owned in the town. A
few miles brought us to the valley of the Laxá or Salmon
river; and here is a very good farm, the owner of it hiring
the salmon fishery, which is the property of the crown.
Several thousand salmon are taken here every year. The
mode of catching them is somewhat peculiar. The river
has two separate channels, and when the fishing season
arrives, by means of two dams, they shut all the current off
of one, and, as the water drains away, there they are, like
whales at ebb tide; and all the fishermen have to do is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>go into the bed of the stream, and pick them up. Then
the water is turned from the other channel into the empty
one, and there the unlucky fish are again caught. The
period of the salmon fishing is one of interest to the whole
community. They are sold very cheap throughout the
country, and those not wanted for immediate consumption
are dried and smoked, and many of them exported. These
smoked salmon are often purchased here as low as a penny
sterling a pound, and taken to England and sold from sixpence
to a shilling.</p>

<p class='c013'>In traveling over the country our “road” was seldom
visible for more than a few rods before us, and sometimes
it was rather difficult to trace. On stony ground the
ponies had to scramble along the best way they could. On
the grass lands there were paths, such as animals traveling
always make. Sometimes these were worn deep through
the turf; and a long man on a short pony, when the paths
are crooked and the speed high, has to keep his feet going
pretty lively, or get his toe-nails knocked off! I got one
fall, and rather an ignominious one. My pony threw me
full length on the grass, but I had not far to fall and soon
picked myself up again. On assessing the damage, I found
it consisted of one button off my coat, a little of the soil of
Iceland on both knees, and a trifle on my face. The pony
kicked up his heels and ran off; but one of the gentlemen
soon caught him, and on I mounted and rode off again.
About half way to Thingvalla, we stopped where there was
some grass for our horses, and had breakfast. Starting at
seven gave a good relish to a <em>dejeuner</em> at eleven o’clock.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>An hour’s rest, and we were again in the saddle. In the
morning it rained hard, but towards noon it cleared up,
and we had pleasant weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our road led through one of the most desolate regions
I ever saw on the face of the earth. But, however rocky
and forbidding in appearance the country may be, there is
always one relief to an Iceland landscape. A fine background
of mountains fills up the picture. Then, too, there
is a magical effect to the atmosphere here that I have never
seen anywhere else. The atmosphere is so pure, the strong
contrasts of black, brown, and red lavas, and the green
fields and snowy mountains, make splendid pictures of landscape
and mountain scenery, even at twenty miles distance.
Captain Laborde said, in all the countries where he had
traveled, he never saw any thing at all like it, except in
Greece. As we approached lake Thingvalla, he said the
mountains opposite formed a perfect Grecian picture. I
have thought myself a pretty good judge of distances, and
have been very much accustomed to measure distances with
my eye, but here all my cunning fails me. At Reykjavik I
looked across the bay at the fine range of the Esjan mountains,
and thought I would like a ramble there. So I asked
a boatman to set me across, and wait till I went up the
mountain and had a view from the top. He looked a little
queer, and asked me how far I thought it was across the
bay. “Well,” I replied, “a couple of miles, probably.”
As the Kentuckian would say, I felt a little “chawed up”
when I was told that it was thirteen or fourteen English
miles, that the mountain was near 3,000 feet high, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>should require a large boat, several men, a guide, and provisions,
and that it would be a long day’s work to begin

<p class='c013'>There are few measured distances in inland travel here.
They go by time, and will tell you it is so many hours’ ride,
or so many days’ journey to such a place. We were seven
hours to-day in going from Reykjavik to Thingvalla, and I
think we averaged five miles an hour. It is probably thirty-five
or thirty-six miles. Much of the way the roads were
bad, and we walked our horses; and when they were good
we put them through at the top of their speed. Our fat
friend with his pony, did not steeple-chase it much;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>About ten miles from Thingvalla we came to a house, a solitary
caravansera in the desert. We concluded to patronize
it, and halted; and while the ponies were contemplating the
beauties of the mineralogical specimens that covered the
ground, we took some refreshment. That is, those who indulge
in the use of the weed that adorns the valleys of the
land of Pocahontas, took a slight fumigation; but having
some ham in my provision-chest, I did not wish to make
smoked meat of myself then. So I pulled from my poke—look
the other way, Father Mathew!—a “pocket-pistol,”
and extracted a small charge! It was not loaded with any
thing stronger than the products of the vineyards of France.
The “hotel” was one story high; and, without trying to
make much of a story about it, it had but one room, walls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of lava, and minus the roof. It is needless to say, the hotel-keeper
had stepped out. It had one piece of furniture, a
wooden bench, and on the slight timbers that supported
what had been a roof, were the names of sundry travelers.
I took out my pencil, and in my boldest chirography wrote
the illustrious name of—“J<span class='fsvs'>OHN</span> S<span class='fsvs'>MITH</span>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A few miles from our caravansera we came to the banks
of the lake of Thingvalla, or, in Icelandic, “Thingvalla
vatn.” This lake is about ten miles long, and the largest
body of water in Iceland. It is of great depth, in some
places over 1,000 feet deep. The town, or place, or what
had been a place, is at the north end of the lake. Just before
arriving there, while jogging along on the level ground,
we came suddenly upon the brink of an immense chasm,
150 feet deep, and about the same in breadth. This was
one of those seams or rents in the earth, common in Iceland;
originally a crack in a bed of lava. Its precipitous
sides and immense depth seemed at once a bar to our progress;
and without a bridge over it, or ropes or wings, we
saw no way of getting along without going round it. Without
seeing either end, and wondering how we were to get
round it, we were told we must go <em>through it</em>. And
sure enough, and the animals, as well as the guides, seemed
to understand it; and if we had kept in our saddles I actually
believe they would have found their way down this
almost perpendicular precipice. We, however, dismounted,
and in a steep defile were shown a passage that much resembled
the “Devil’s Staircase,” at the Pass of Glencoe, in
the Highlands of Scotland. By picking and clambering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>our way down some pretty regular stairs—and our horses
followed without our holding their bridles—we made our
way to the bottom. There we found grass growing; and,
while our ponies were feeding, we lay on the turf and admired
this singular freak of nature. We were in the bottom
of a deep chasm or defile, the wall on the west side
being over a hundred feet high and on a level with the
country back of it. The wall on the east side was lower,
and beyond this wall the country was on a level with the
bottom where we were. By walking a short distance to the
north, in this singular defile, we found the wall on the east
side broken down by a river that poured down the precipice
from the west, and being thus imprisoned between two walls,
it had thrown down the lowest one, and found its way into
the Thingvalla lake. This chasm is called the <em>Almannagjá</em>
(pronounced Al-man-a-gow), or “all men’s cave.” In former
days, when the Althing, or Icelandic Congress, met at
the place, all men of consequence, or nearly all, used to assemble
here; and no doubt they admired this singular freak
of nature. The river here, the Oxerá, in pouring over the
precipice forms a most splendid cataract. Here is Thingvalla,
a once important place, and, as I have mentioned, for
nearly a thousand years the capital of the nation. It is now
a mere farm, and contains two huts and a very small church.
This church is on about the same scale of most of the
churches in Iceland. It is a wooden building, about
eighteen feet long by twelve wide, with a door less than five
feet high. It is customary for the clergyman or farmer—and
the owner of the land is often both—to store his provisions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>boxes of clothing, dried fish, &amp;c., in the church; and
strangers in the country often sleep in the churches. Some
travelers have made a great outcry about the desecration of
turning a church into a hotel, but with all their squeamishness
have usually fallen into the general custom. Surely if
their tender consciences went against it, they had “all out
doors” for a lodging place. I have not yet arrived at the
honor of sleeping in a church, though I have slept out of
doors; and when I have tried both, I will tell which I like
best. A tent has been presented to the important “town” of
Thingvalla, by the liberality of the French officers who
visit the coast; and this was pitched for our use. The clergyman
here—who is also farmer and fisherman—a pale,
spare, intellectual-looking young man, received us very
kindly. It was the haying season, and the ground was covered
with the new-mown hay. Two of the working-men of
the farm had that day been out on the lake, fishing in a
small boat. They came to the shore as we rode up, and I
had the curiosity to go and see what they had caught.
And what had they? Who can guess? No one. Over
two hundred and fifty fresh-water trout, all alive “and kicking.”
They were large, handsome fellows, and would weigh
from one to three pounds each. Not a fish that wouldn’t
weigh over a pound. But didn’t I scream? “Oh, Captain
Laborde! Rector Johnson! I say; come and see the fish.
Speckled trout, more than two barrels-full.” Well, hang
up my fish-hooks; I’ll never troll another line in Sandy
Creek. The tent pitched, some trout dressed, and a fire
built in the smithy, and we soon had a dinner cooking.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>And such a dinner! Well, say French naval officers on
shore, Icelanders, Yankees, and Cosmopolites, can not enjoy
life “in the tented field”! But this chapter is long enough,
and I’ll tell about the dinner in my next.</p>

Alexander, believed that his immortal Essay would have
been translated into Icelandic verse by a native Icelander,
and read throughout the country, he would not have vaulted
clear over the volcanic isle in his enumeration of places at
“the North.” And then, too, our poetical Pope is the only
pontiff who has any admirers in this northern land. The
last Catholic bishop of the country left few believers of
that faith in the island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yesterday, under the canvas of an Iceland tent, a party
was seated at dinner. It was on the bank of the Thingvalla
vatn. The hospitable clergyman furnished us trout,
and a good sportsman among the French officers produced
several fine birds, plovers and curlews that he had shot on
the way, often without leaving his horse. We had excellent
milk and cream from the farm, and the packing-cases
of the party furnished the balance of as good a dinner as
hungry travelers ever sat down to. The Frenchmen—like
those in the Peninsular war, who gathered vegetables to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>boil with their beef, rather than roast it alone as the English
soldiers did theirs—our Frenchmen—gathered some plants,
that looked to me very like dandelions, and dressed them
with oil and vinegar for salad. Though it was rather a failure,
it showed that an eye was open to the productions of the
country, albeit it was not a perfect garden. I picked a bird
for my share of the work—picked him clean, too, and his
bones afterwards—and found it as good as a grouse or
pheasant. With fine Iceland brushwood from a “forest”
hard by, a fire was made in the blacksmith shop, and there
we roasted fish, flesh, and fowl. As the rest of the party
were to return the next day to Reykjavik, and as I had a
long tour before me, they would not allow me to produce
any thing towards the feast, but insisted on my dining with
them. I was too old a traveler to refuse a good invitation,
and accepted at once. The tent was pitched on a smooth
plat of grass before the lake, and a quantity of new-mown
hay, with our traveling blankets and saddles, made
first-rate seats. I know not when I have enjoyed a dinner
more than I did this. The Frenchmen conversed with their
own tongues in their own language; some of the party
spoke Danish, and several Icelandic; I gave them English—and
every other language that I knew—the modest Iceland
clergyman expressed himself in Latin, and Rector
Johnson talked them all. Time flew by—as he always flies,
the old bird!—while the big white loaves, the trout, the
game-birds, the sardines, ham, and bottles of wine, disappeared
rapidly. We drank, not deeply, to all the people
in the world—kings and rulers excepted, for they always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>have enough to drink to their good health and long life;
and we toasted, among others, “all travelers of every nation,
and in all climes, whether on land or sea,” and hoped
that none were “seeing the elephant” more extensively
than we were. So passed our dinner. The clergyman was
with us; and he appeared to enjoy the foreign luxuries, as we
all enjoyed everything about us, viands, company, scenery, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c013'>Touching the fish that swim hereabouts, and the so-called
“sport” of angling, I am told that the Iceland trout
and salmon show a most barbarous indifference to the attractive
colors of all artificial flies that are ever thrown them
by scientific piscators. Our clerical farmer-fisherman who
hauls up the finny tribes in the Thingvalla vatn, uses no
barbed piece of steel to tear their innocent gills—“a pole
and a string, with a worm at one end and a fool at the
other”—but pulls them up in crowds with a net. He seems
to think as some others do of the barbarous old angler,</p>

      <div class='line in1'>Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After dinner, the clergyman took us about to show us
the “lions” of the place. Thingvalla, in a historical point
of view, is by far the most celebrated and interesting
locality in Iceland. An account of their republican congress
or Althing, that met here, has been given in a former
chapter. The meeting of courts and legislative bodies,
among all the Scandinavian tribes, was in the open air.
The word Thingvalla is from <em>thing</em>, a court of justice, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><em>valla</em>, a plain. Undoubtedly from the same origin are the
names of Tingwall, in Shetland, and Dingwall, in the north
of Scotland. The cognomen “law” is given to several
hills in Scotland, and undoubtedly in consequence of courts
of law being held on them in former times. Such is the
tradition attached to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The place here where the Althing met was a most
singular and convenient one. Except from six to twelve
inches or more of soil on top, the earth here is solid rock
that was once lava. There are two wide and deep seams
or cracks in this lava-rock, that meet at an acute angle,
and stretch away in different directions into the plain.
Between these, in a small hollow, shaped like an amphitheater,
is the place where the Althing met. These seams
or chasms are like natural canals, from twenty to fifty feet
wide, and said to be two hundred feet deep. They are
filled up to within twenty or thirty feet of the top, with
still, black-looking water, and are said to have a subterranean
communication with the lake about half a mile
distant. Here, on this triangular piece of ground, covered
with grassy turf, the general assembly of the nation
gathered once a year, in the summer season. Those connected
with the Althing were inside these natural chasms,
but spectators were outside, beyond the boundaries of the
court. This was, indeed, a primitive house of representatives.
Though the Icelanders are a staid, sober, matter-of-fact
people, undoubtedly many anecdotes and singular
legislative scenes could be related of events that have
transpired at this spot. One was told us by the clergyman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>which, from its singular character, has been handed down,
though it took place long years ago. The Althing, having
both legislative and judicial powers, tried criminals and
adjusted differences, as well as made laws. A man was
undergoing his trial for a capital offense; and, though in
irons, he watched his opportunity and ran, and with one
fearful leap vaulted clear across one of the chasms that
formed the boundary of the court. We were shown the
spot. It is twenty feet wide, and on the opposite side the
ground was several feet higher than the bank where he
started. The legend says he got clear off, and thus saved
his life; going on the principle which the Indian adopted,
that if you hang a rogue you must catch him first. Near
this primitive capitol is a pool of deep, black-looking water,
where females convicted of capital crimes were drowned.
A little to the west, we were shown an island in the river,
where male culprits were beheaded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another evidence of the civilization of the people
during a former age, was shown, quite as palpable as any
similar signs in either Old or New England. This was the
spot where witches were burned; as late, too, as the commencement
of the eighteenth century. How singular are
some cotemporaneous events! As the unseen pestilence
sweeps through the atmosphere, from one nation to another,
so will a moral plague, like the delusion of witchcraft,
enchain the minds of a Christian community, and spread
death and devastation before it. There are scenes and
events in the history of all nations, that the people would
gladly blot out if they could. One of our party, a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>intelligent Icelander, told us he had seen, not forty years
before, heaps of charred bones, and ashes, on this spot, where
innocent people were sacrificed to a belief in witchcraft.</p>

<p class='c013'>But these assemblies at Thingvalla were principally
identified with more pleasant scenes. There was something
besides the mere sitting of the supreme court, and the
gathering of the people’s congress. Sir George Mackenzie
has happily expressed the interest of these gatherings.
“At the assemblies at Thingvalla,” he says, “though
artificial splendor was wanting, yet the majesty of nature
presided, and gave a superior and more impressive solemnity
to the scene. On the banks of the river Oxerá, where its
rapid stream enters a lake embosomed among dark and
precipitous mountains, was held during more than eight
centuries the annual convention of the people. It is a spot
of singular wildness and desolation; on every side of which
appear the most tremendous effects of ancient convulsion
and disorder, while nature now sleeps in a death-like
silence which she has formed. Here the legislators, the
magistrates, and the people, met together. Their little
group of tents, placed beside the stream, was sheltered
behind by a rugged precipice of lava; and on a small,
grassy spot in the midst of them was held the assembly
which provided, by its deliberations, for the happiness and
tranquillity of the nation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The people looked forward to these annual gatherings
with great interest. They met here in large numbers, and
from all parts of the country. Friend met friend, sociality
prevailed, commodities were interchanged, business was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>transacted, and all intermingled in agreeable, social intercourse.
Many families being here during the time, young
men found wives, and maidens obtained husbands; so that
the bow of Cupid flung his arrows near the scales of justice.
Here, too, idolatry first gave way in Iceland, and here the
Christian religion was first publicly acknowledged. This
was in the year 1000. At that time, nearly all the people
were idolaters. Several zealous Christians were present,
and the subject was discussed at the Althing. The debate
waxed warm, and while the discussion was going on, a
messenger rushed into the assembly with the intelligence
that a volcanic eruption had broken out but a short
distance to the south. The idolaters declared it was
merely the wrath of their gods at the people for turning
away from their ancient creed. “But what,” says Snorro
Goda, a Christian, “were the gods angry at, when the very
rocks where we stand, hundreds of years ago, were melted
lava?” The question was unanswerable, the Christians
triumphed, and laws were immediately passed protecting
all in the exercise of their religion. The ecclesiastical
courts were afterwards held here, under the bishop of Skalholt.
It is not to be wondered at, that the people wept
when the Althing was removed to Reykjavik. Hallowed
by the reminiscences of the past, they saw modern innovation
and foreign customs break up one of their ancient and
venerable institutions. The Althing is forever removed:
their council circle is now a meadow, and I see oxen,
sheep, and horses grazing around it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Laborde took me slily by the arm, led me one-side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>to a cleft in the lava, and waving his hand towards it,
said he begged to have the honor of introducing me to an
Iceland tree. And sure enough there it stood, green and
flourishing, but of such dimensions that, had I not been
aware I was in Iceland, I should have been irreverent
enough to have called it a mere shrub, a bush, or perhaps
a bramble. I find I was very rash in pronouncing the
opinion which I did, that the bush, some five feet in height,
that I saw in the governor’s garden was probably the
largest tree in Iceland. Now, here was one towering alone
in the majesty of luxuriant nature, at least six feet perpendicular;
and were the various crooks and bends that adorn
its trunk, straightened out, I have no doubt but it would
be nine or ten inches higher. I took off my hat, and made
a low bow to it. In a meadow near the house, was a rather
novel sight—two girls milking the ewes. Here, as elsewhere,
we were furnished with excellent milk and cream.
Many a bowl of rich milk have I drank in this country, and
never asked where the article came from. After riding all
day, and at night going up to a farm-house, half exhausted
with hunger and thirst, and getting what would quench it,
I have found something else to think of besides letting my
fancy go wool-gathering among snowy fleeces, and bleating
lambs that go without their supper. When a man leaves
his own fireside and country, and goes abroad, he has no
business to take all of his prejudices and fastidiousness
along with him.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>With the new hay for a bed, our blankets spread
over us, and our saddles for pillows, we enjoyed a most
refreshing sleep. At breakfast this morning, the clergyman-farmer’s
dairy and fishing-boat were again laid under
contribution. A large raven, one of a pair we had noticed
frequently, flew slowly up towards our tent, apparently
looking for something to break his fast. Our fowler
saluted him with a charge of fine shot, that sent him
off at a tangent, and left him minus some of his feathers.
A word touching these ravens hereafter. They are among
the most ancient of the inhabitants of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was with great regret that I parted from my most
agreeable and intelligent company—but separate we must.
The French officers, Rector Johnson, and the others, prepared
to return to Reykjavik, and I to go towards the east,
on a tour of several hundred miles in the interior. They
would gladly have continued with me as far as the Geysers,
but for some good and weighty reasons. One was, they
had no guide to return with them who understood the
road, and mine must go on with me. Another reason was,
we had all made such terrible havoc with their provision
chest, that the remainder would scarcely have stood before
a Captain Dugald Dalgetty for a day’s campaign. Then,
too, fishing-ponds ten miles long and a thousand feet deep,
and yielding trout by the boat-load, are not to be found in
every valley, even in Iceland. So a hearty shaking of
hands, and a buckling of girths, and we were once more in
our saddles; they returning to town, and I and my guide,
with faces towards the rising sun, going to see those
wonders of nature—the great Geysers of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>W<span class='fsvs'>E</span> shall climb over the mountains and their hard
names, and gallop through the valleys a little more
smoothly, if we look at the spelling, pronunciation, and
meaning of some of the Icelandic terms. A great appropriateness
will be seen in nearly all the geographical names
in Iceland. By translating the language, we shall see some
characteristic feature embodied in the name of about every
place, river, lake, mountain, bay, and island in the country.
The explanation of a few Icelandic words will show the
signification of many of the names that I shall have
occasion to mention. The letter <em>á</em> (pronounced <em>ow</em>) signifies
river, and is the last letter in the names of Icelandic
rivers. <em>Bru</em> is a bridge, hence <em>bruará</em>, or bridge river.
<em>Hvit</em> is white; <em>vatn</em>, water or lake; <em>hvitá</em>, white river; <em>hvitarvatn</em>,
white lake. <em>Hver</em> is a hot spring; <em>laug</em> (pronounced
<em>lage</em>), a warm spring, and <em>dalr</em>, a dale or vale. There is a
valley north of Hekla, known as <em>Laugardalr</em>, or vale of
warm springs. The Icelanders pronounce double <em>l</em> at the
end of words, like <em>tl</em>. They have a distinct name for each
description of mountain. <em>Jokull</em> (pronounced <em>yo-kut-l</em>; or,
spoken rapidly as the Icelanders speak, it sounds about like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><em>yo-kul</em>) is the term used to designate mountains that are
covered with perpetual ice. <em>Fell</em>, <em>fjall</em>, and <em>fjöll</em> (pronounced
<em>fee-et-l</em>, <em>fee-aht-l</em>, and <em>fee-ote-l</em>), all signify mountains,
but <em>fell</em> is applied to single peaks, to small and
isolated mountains, and <em>fjall</em> and <em>fjöll</em> to large mountains,
or chains of mountains. <em>Bla</em> is blue; <em>snæ</em>, snow; and we
have <em>blafell</em>, or a blue mountain standing alone—an
isolated peak in the middle of a plain. A celebrated
mountain in the west of Iceland, is <em>Snæfell Jokull</em> (<em>snef-el-yo-kul</em>),
a snowy mountain, standing alone, and covered with
perpetual ice; and in the comprehensive language of the
Icelanders, it is all expressed in two words. <em>Oræfa</em> signifies
desert or sandy plain, and <em>torf</em> is turf or peat. There are
two mountains, <em>Oræfa Jokull</em> and <em>Torfa Jokull</em>; one
standing in a desert, and the other in a large peat district.
One portion of the immense mountain, the Skaptar Jokull,
is known as <em>Vatna Jokull</em>, as it is supposed to contain, on
a portion of its surface, large pools of standing water. The
points of compass are, <em>north</em>, <em>suth</em>, <em>æst</em>, and <em>vest</em>. <em>Eyjar</em>
signifies islands. South of Hekla is a lofty and celebrated
mountain known as the <em>Eyjafjalla Jokull</em>. To an English
reader, unacquainted with the Icelandic, it is a crooked-looking
mouthful; but on the tongue of an Icelander,
it flows off, a round, smooth, sonorous term. They call it
<em>i-a-fe-aht-la yo-kull</em>. It defines itself as ice mountain of
islands, having numerous knobs or peaks that stand up
like islands in the sea. Many Icelandic words are identical
with the English, and many others nearly so. It remains
for some future lexicographer to show the great number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>English words that are derived from the Icelandic. The
points of compass have been noticed; a few more examples
will suffice. <em>Hestr</em> is a horse; <em>holt</em>, a hill; <em>hus</em>, a house;
<em>hval</em>, a whale; <em>lang</em>, long; <em>men</em>, men; <em>mann</em>, man; <em>sandr</em>,
sand; <em>sitha</em>, the side; <em>gerthi</em>, a garden; <em>litil</em>, little; <em>mikla</em>,
large (Scottish, <em>muckle</em>); <em>myri</em>, a bog or miry place;
<em>fjorth</em>, is a firth or bay; <em>kirkja</em>, a church; <em>prestur</em>, a
priest; <em>morgun</em>, morning; <em>ux</em>, ox; <em>daga</em>, days. “July,
or midsummer month,” stands literally in Icelandic, <em>Julius
etha mithsumar-manuthur</em>. <em>J</em>, at the beginning of words
and syllables in the Icelandic, is pronounced like <em>y</em> consonant,
and in the middle of a syllable, like <em>i</em> or long <em>e</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their affirmative <em>yes</em>, is <em>já</em> (pronounced <em>yow</em>), and their
<em>no</em> is <em>nei</em> (nay). Their counting is much like ours: einn
(1), tveir (2), thrir (3), fjorir (4), fimm (5), sex (6), sjö (7),

these examples are sufficient for my purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have a few words for my friends the geographers,
who, in their anxiety to Anglicize geographical names,
so completely change them that the natives of a country
would not recognize their own rivers and mountains when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>once disguised in an English dress. The Icelandic is the
only one of the old Scandinavian tongues that has the
sound of <em>th</em>; and they have two different letters, one to
represent <em>th</em> in <em>thank</em>, and the other the <em>th</em> as heard in
<em>this</em>. The latter sound is heard in <em>fiorth</em> and in <em>north</em><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>—different
from our pronunciation of north; and as the
letter representing this sound of <em>th</em> is a character that
some resembles the letter <em>d</em>, we find the above words
written and printed by the English as <em>fiord</em> and <em>nord</em>.
With the Danes and Swedes, who have neither the sounds
nor the letters, it is not to be wondered at that they use <em>d</em>
or <em>t</em> for these sounds. I shall give the Icelandic names in
their native spelling, as near as possible, with perhaps the
exception of the name of the country,—which they write
<em>Island</em>, but now with us is thoroughly Anglicized as
Iceland. They pronounce it <em>ees-land</em>, the <em>a</em> in the last
syllable rather broad. I see no particular objection to
using <em>y</em> for <em>j</em> in jokull, as it has that sound; or in substituting
<em>i</em> for the same letter in <em>fjorth</em>, <em>Reykjavik</em>, <em>Eyjafjalla</em>,
and similar cases. I will, however, protest against an
Icelandic <em>Thane</em> being turned into a <em>Dane</em>, without as
much as saying, “By your leave, sir,” or ever asking him
if he wished to change his allegiance.</p>

<p class='c013'>O<span class='fsvs'>N</span> a bright and beautiful morning, as my agreeable
company of the day previous disappeared behind the walls
of the Almannagjá, my small party turned towards the east,
the bridle-path leading through a forest several miles in
extent. Before getting into the thickest of the wood, we
found the ground covered with immense rocks of lava, and
look which way we would, except a few feet of the path
directly before us, the country appeared quite impassable.
It may excite a smile to talk of a forest, with the largest
trees but six or seven feet high; but these patches of
shrubbery dispersed over Iceland, are of great value to the
people. They are composed principally of birch and
willow. Though nothing but scraggy brush, it is used
to make roofs to their houses, and much of it is burned
into charcoal for their blacksmithing. I have seen one of
their coalpits where they were burning charcoal, and a
bushel basket would have nearly covered it. Attached to
every farm-house is a “smithy,” where scythes, pitchforks,
spades, horse-shoes, and other articles, are made. Every
man is a blacksmith; and some travelers have asserted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>that the clergy are the best shoers of horses in the land.
A Gretna Green blacksmith will answer in case of emergency
for a clergyman; and Sir George Mackenzie, while
traveling here, had his horse shod several times by Iceland
priests. I have not yet had an opportunity of testing the
skill of one of these clerical blacksmiths. They have,
at least, a poetical license for practising the two trades;
though perhaps they do not put the shoe on the horse as
much as formerly, but</p>

<p class='c013'>We crossed one of those deep chasms or cracks in the
lava, so common in volcanic regions. Here a natural
bridge of lava was left, apparently on purpose for a road
across it. While riding along in this miniature forest,
a large flock or brood of ptarmigans flew up before us.
This, one of the fine game-birds of the mountainous parts
of Scotland, is very common in Iceland. From being long
out of the habit of shooting, I believe the murderous
propensities bred in my youth—with “dad’s old musket”—have
pretty nearly all evaporated. And why should I
regret it? A more cheerful or happy sight than flocks
of beautiful birds, young and old, cannot be seen. Then
see the terrible contrast of “sulphurous smoke and dreadful
slaughter,” that follows the “fowler’s murder-aiming
eye,” and all for “sport.” The ptarmigan, I believe, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>seldom found in America. It is about the size of the
partridge of the State of New York, a greyish brown
in summer, and turning quite white in winter. The Icelanders
call this bird the <em>reaper</em>. Had they game laws
here—and thank heaven they don’t require them—it
would not be permitted to shoot this bird at this season.
The young in this flock, though able to fly short distances,
were not over half grown. I have a bit of a confession to
make, and I may as well make it now. The day that
I was traveling was Sunday! I met several parties of
Icelanders, traveling also; the immediate object of our
journeying being different: they were going to church,
and I was going to see the Geysers. The parties I met
were going towards the Thingvalla church, and had on
their Sunday’s best. They were all on horseback, the
universal way of traveling in this country. Indeed, indeed,
it was very queer, the riding of the young Icelandic ladies.
These pretty damsels rode just like their brothers. My
pen refuses a more elaborate and bifurcated description.
The matrons all had a very convenient kind of side-saddle.
It was like an arm-chair, the back and arms forming part
of a circle, all in one piece. The dame rides exactly
sideways, at a right angle with her horse, her feet placed
on a sort of wooden step. The saddle must be pretty
heavy, but the little animals and their riders seemed to get
along very well. There was nothing peculiar about the
costume of the females, except the little black caps with
long silk tassels, universally worn in Iceland, in doors and
out, in place of any other cap or bonnet.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>We journeyed towards the south, skirting the shore
of the lake some five miles, and then turned to the east,
climbing a sharp and steep mountain, but not of great
height. From the top we had a fine view of the surrounding
country, and to the west, the broad lake, the
“Thingvalla vatn.” Across the lake, some ten miles
distant—though, from the magical purity of the atmosphere,
it seemed but a stone’s throw—was a range of
mountains, sloping down to the water’s edge, with patches
of snow on their sides. Directly beneath us, at the foot of
the mountain, lay the lake with its myriads of trout, and
its water a thousand feet deep. Two abrupt islands rise
high above the surface. They are mere hills of lava and
volcanic matter, without a particle of vegetation. They
are called Sandey and Nesey. We traveled some little
distance on the broad, flat surface of the mountain, and
crossed—by descending into it—one of the deep lava
chasms. We did not descend, in going down the mountain
to the east, as much as we had ascended; but found
it spread itself out into a broad table-land, a number
of hundred feet higher than the lake. With long ranges
of mountains before us, we traveled several miles over a
most desolate volcanic region, completely covered with
lava rocks, scoriæ, and volcanic sand. Like all the lava-covered
country, it was broken up in huge, irregular
masses, and very cavernous, in some places showing caves
thirty or forty feet deep. No description or picture will
give a good idea of the old lava on the surface of the
ground, to a person who has never been in a volcanic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>country. Not the roughest lime-stone region I have ever
seen will bear the slightest comparison with the lava-covered
districts—near two-thirds of the surface—of Iceland.
In written descriptions of volcanic regions, we often
see mention made of “streams of lava.” These streams
in other countries are usually down the sides of mountains,
but here in Iceland they extend for miles along the surface
of the level ground, and we are puzzled to know where it
came from, for usually we see no crater or mountain anywhere
near. I have seen these “streams” standing up in
bold relief, a black, rough, horrid mass, from ten to a
hundred feet deep, several hundred yards wide, and one or
two miles in length. Brydone, in his observations of Mt.
Ætna, pulled all the old theologians about his ears by
making a calculation respecting the age of the lava, and
proving conclusively—to himself—that some of the lava
streams from Ætna were fourteen thousand years old.
I believe, however, that philosophers have to own themselves
baffled in trying to get at the age of lava. After
cooling—which often takes some years—and breaking up
by the expansion of the air in it, the lava is usually nearly
or quite black. After several hundred years it turns a
little more towards a brown, or rather gets grey with age,
and is covered with a very slight coating of one of the most
inferior of the mosses. Very old lava often gets quite
rotten, light, and porous, and in this state is frequently
very red. Take a thick piece of zinc and break it with a
hammer, and you will have a rough surface that, multiplied
ten thousand times, will give some idea of a stream of lava.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The word “horrible,” both in the Icelandic and in English
descriptions, is often and most appropriately applied to the
fields of lava.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we traveled east and approached nearer and nearer
the range of mountains, the way became much smoother
till we found ourselves on a plain of black, volcanic
sand. Near the base of the mountain range before us,
the guide took me aside a hundred yards or so to see a
curious volcanic crater called the Tin Tron. It stands near
twenty feet above the surface of the ground, like a chimney,
but on climbing up the side of it and looking down into it,
it appears like a well, but the cavity grows much wider
below the surface of the ground. On throwing in a stone,
after a little period, it quashed in a bed of water, seemingly
some fifty feet below where we stood. One side of it was
partly broken away, so we did not have to climb clear to
the top of it to look down the aperture. I broke off some
pieces of lava from the top of the crater with my hands,
and found it very soft, light, and porous. This lava was a
beautiful purple, and some of it a bright red color. I
brought away several samples. We wound round the
mountain and descended into a broad and fertile valley
called the “<em>Laugardalr</em>,” or vale of warm springs. Broad
meadows surrounded us, and we could see the steam rising
from numerous hot springs in the distance. This valley
appeared like an immense amphitheatre surrounded by
mountains. I know not that a painter could make much of
it, but the Laugardalr is a fine landscape. It is not like a
vale in Derbyshire, or a country scene on the banks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Connecticut. No forests, no grain fields, orchards, fences,
or houses, and yet it is a scene of great interest, and not
easily forgotten.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had plenty of time, as we wound our way slowly
down the hillside from the elevated table land, and an
opportunity to observe the peculiarities of the country.
Certain little green hillocks to my now more practised eye
showed themselves to me as habitations. To the left lay a
smooth lake, and in bright lines through the green meadow
land were several white looking rivers. On every side
were high mountains, many of them covered on the tops
with snow. Here I got the first view of Hekla, though
more than forty miles distant. It was black nearly to the
top, where were some small snow banks. This valley,
including much that is beyond the Laugardalr, is one of
the most extensive and fertile farming districts in Iceland.
It extends nearly one hundred miles south to the Atlantic
ocean, and is bounded on the east and southeast by Mt.
Hekla and the Tindfjalla and Eyjafjalla Jokulls. This
tract of country is watered by Iceland’s largest rivers; the
Hvitá or White river, the Brúará, the Túngufljot, the
Laxá, and the Thjorsá.</p>

<p class='c013'>We stopped near the first farm-house, and had the
saddles taken off, that the ponies could recruit a little on
the fine meadow grass, while we went through that very
necessary daily ceremony of dining. The farmer sent me
out some excellent milk in a Staffordshire bowl, and soon
after he and his wife and daughter came out to see me
hide it under my jacket. Madame Pfeiffer, in her snarling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ill-tempered journal, complains greatly of the idle curiosity
of the people in crowding about and looking at her. From
what I heard of her, she was so haughty that the simple
and hospitable Icelanders could not approach her near
enough to show her any attentions. I exhausted my little
stock of Icelandic in talking with the farmer, praised his
farm, his cows, the milk, his country, his wife and daughter,
called the latter handsome—“<em>fallegh stulkey</em>”—what a
lie!—and giving him a piece of silver, which he seemed to
like better than all the “fair words”—“butter without
parsneps”—and, jumping into our saddles, away we went.</p>

<p class='c013'>We passed near the small lake, the <em>Laugarvatn</em>, and
saw the steam rising from the hot springs near it, but
being out of our way we did not visit them. Several hot
springs have their source in the bottom of the lake, and
only reveal their existence by the steam that rises from the
surface of the water. We got into a fine road in a large
meadow or bottom land, and I was having a fine gallop
across the plain, when the guide called to me to turn aside.
I was greatly provoked on his taking me a mile out of
the way to show me a cave in the hill side, which he
seemed to think was a great curiosity. This wonderful
cavern was about twenty feet deep! I “blowed him up”
well for a stupid fellow, and told him he need not show a
cave like that to an American, for we had caves that
extended under ground farther than from there to the
Geysers—some ten miles ahead—and cared very little for
such a fox burrow as that. He said he showed it to
English gentlemen, and they thought it very grand! Well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>I told him, he might show it to English gentlemen, but he
better not to Yankees, if he consulted his reputation as a
guide. Rising a hill we saw to our right another lake, the
<em>Apavatn</em>. We crossed the Brúará or Bridge river, the only
river in Iceland—with one exception, the <em>Jokulsá</em>, in the
east country—that has a bridge over it. This bridge does
not span the river by any means, but it merely crosses a
chasm or deep place in the middle of the stream. Our
horses waded over the rocky bottom and shallow water
forty or fifty yards, when we came to a deep chasm, perhaps
ten yards across, and over this a slight wooden structure,
about six feet wide, was thrown. In this chasm the water
is a most furious torrent, roaring some fifty feet below the
bridge. Our horses were some frightened, and required
considerable urging to get them to cross the frail bridge.
The chasm commences but a little way up the river from the
bridge, and there the greatest share of the water in the
river pours into it, forming a furious and singular cataract.
I stopped my horse a few moments on the bridge, and looked
at the angry torrent as it rushed beneath me. The water,
except where broken into foam, has a deep green appearance.
On the road from Thingvalla to the Geysers, nearly all the
way, we had mountains on our left, and fine fertile meadows
on the right, towards the south. A great deal of the way,
a ridge of lava extends along the foot of the mountain, and
sometimes, for a long distance, I noticed a strip of fine
meadow land between the foot of the mountain and this
ridge of lava, the meadow as well as the strip of lava being
several hundred yards wide. How this came to be so I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>could not tell, unless it happened that, after the last eruption
of lava, large quantities of ashes were thrown out of the
mountain, covering the lava for some distance from its base,
and thus forming a coat of soil where now the green
meadow is seen. As I have mentioned before, nearly every
foot of land in Iceland shows proofs of volcanic origin, and,
without doubt, the entire island was formed by volcanic
action. At whatever period that took place, if mortal man
could have seen it, there would have been a picture of the
power of the Almighty most awful to behold. What a scene!
A tract of land forty thousand square miles in extent,
rising amidst fire and smoke and earthquakes, from the
bottom of the ocean. The proofs of subterranean fire
shown at the present day, in the occasional action of the
volcanoes, and constant spouting of numerous geysers and
hot springs of water and boiling mud, exhibit scenes of
sublimity and grandeur unequaled on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Crossing a high ridge of lava and winding around the
Bjarnarfell mountain, we came in sight of the Geysers, with
the clouds of steam rising up, at the base of a hill about
three miles from us. We crossed some small streams that
came from the Geysers, and observed that the waters were
covered with a gilded kind of metallic lustre, such as we often
see in stagnant pools. This arose, undoubtedly, from some
metallic property in the water itself. Shakspeare, whose eye
never missed an appearance of nature, usual or unusual,
observed this. In <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, a man had been
off on some expedition, and had no doubt “seen the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>elephant” somewhere on his route, for on his return one of
his comrades said to him,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——“thou didst drink the gilded puddle</div>
      <div class='line'>That beasts would cough at.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These waters are very good for immersion, if one wants an
outward application in the shape of a hot bath, but I think
for drinking I would imbibe the “gilded puddle” in Warwickshire
rather than suck the slimy waters that flow from
the Geysers. Eager to see these wonders of nature, I
spurred my pony up to the margin of the basin of the Great
Geyser, and, though in a quiescent state, I shall never forget
its appearance while memory holds her seat in my brain.
The guide soon led the way to the farmhouse and church
of Haukadalr, nearly a mile to the east, where we were to
pass the night. A drizzling rain had been falling; I was
wet, and greatly fatigued by the unusual exercise of riding
on horseback, and glad to get some rest, and defer my
examination of the place and its curiosities until the next
day. The farmhouse, with its furniture, was better than the
average in Iceland, and offered passable accommodations for
a weary traveler. After a cup of tea, taken from stores in
my own knapsack, I went to my room, crawled under the
bed, and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>M<span class='fsvs'>ONDAY</span>, July 26th, 1852, I spent at the Geysers. They
rise out of the ground near the base of a hill some three
hundred feet in height. Most of the hot springs I have
seen in Iceland are at the base of hills. The Geysers are on
ground that is nearly level, sloping a little from the hill, and
cover fifty acres or more. The springs are over one hundred
in number, and of every size and form, some very large,
others small, scarcely discharging any water at all. The
Great Geyser—“<em>the</em> Geyser” par excellence—attracts by far
the most attention, as from its great size, the quantity of water
it discharges, and the magnitude and splendor of its eruptions,
it stands unequaled in the world. It is on a little
eminence that it has made for itself, a hollow rock or petrified
mass that has been formed by a siliceous deposit from
the water. On approaching the place, you readily see
where the Great Geyser is, by its large quantity of steam.
I walked up the margin of it, and there it was, perfectly
quiescent, like a sleeping infant. It is shaped exactly like a
tea-saucer, in appearance circular, though it is a little elliptical.
By measurement, the larger diameter is fifty-six feet,
and the smaller diameter forty-six feet. When I arrived I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>found this saucer or basin full of hot water, as clear as crystal.
The temperature, by Fahrenheit’s thermometer, was
209° above zero, only three degrees below the boiling point.
The basin itself is four feet deep, and in the centre there is a
round hole or “pipe,” as it is called, running down into the
earth like a well. At the top where it opens into the basin,
this pipe is sixteen feet across, but a little below the surface
it is said to be but ten feet in diameter. This pipe is round,
smooth, and straight, and is said by Sir George Mackenzie
and others who have measured it, to extend perpendicularly
to a depth of 65 feet. The rocky bottom and sides of the
basin and pipe are smooth and of a light color, nearly
white. The quantity of steam that escaped from the surface
was considerable, but not nearly so great as I should
suppose would come from such a body of hot water. Such
is the appearance of this most remarkable fountain while
still, and certainly it does not look like a violent or dangerous
pool. Without wishing to augur ill of it, certainly it is
a great bore. When in an active state, the Geyser is altogether
a different thing. When I arrived in the evening,
the basin was not over half full of water, but the next morning
it was full and running over, though the quantity of
water that flows from it is not very great. A slight rising
of the water, as if boiling, is seen in the middle of the basin
directly over the pipe when in a quiescent state. Now arrived
at the Geyser, we must wait its motion, for the eruptions
occur at very irregular intervals, sometimes several
times a day, and sometimes but once in two or three days.
Knowing that it gave a warning—by firing signal-guns—before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>each eruption, I took the time to go about the
grounds and see what there was to be seen. I gathered
some fine mineralogical specimens, some beautiful samples
of petrified peat, or turf, all roots and vegetable matter
turned to stone. Fifteen or twenty yards west of the Geyser
is a gully or ravine, with nearly perpendicular sides, and
thirty or forty feet deep. I went down into this, and found
a little rivulet of warm water in it, the banks being composed
of volcanic matter and red earth. I heard a gurgling
noise in the bank, and went up to it, and there was a little
mud spring of blubbering clay, hot and steaming. While
in this ravine, I heard a sudden noise of explosions like cannon
two or three miles away, and yet it seemed to be near
me, and under the Great Geyser. It was the subterranean
explosions that always precede an eruption. I ran up to
the Geyser, and saw the water in a violent state of agitation
and boiling, with considerable air coming up out of the
pipe to the surface. This was all; only a false alarm, and
not an eruption. Off I went, on another exploring expedition
about the grounds. I heard a violent gurgling up towards
the foot of the hill to the west, and went to see the
cause of it. About 150 yards from the Great Geyser I
found a jet of steam coming out of a hole in the ground,
and down out of sight I could hear mud boiling and sputtering
violently. I noticed here what I had heard was a characteristic
of the hot springs of Iceland, deposits of clay of
different colors and of great beauty. It was moist, in a state
somewhat like putty, and lying in layers, in several distinct
colors. Red, blue, and white were the prevailing tints. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>was most fine-grained and beautiful, and I could not help
thinking would be of considerable value as paints, if it
were collected. I gathered some of it, but in the absence
of proper things to carry it in, and the long journey before
me, I reluctantly left the samples behind. About 140 yards
southwest of the Great Geyser I came upon two deep
springs or pools of clear water, hissing hot and steaming.
These pools appeared two springs of irregular outline, each
from 10 to 15 feet across, and nearly or quite 30 feet deep.
The water was so clear I could see directly to the bottom.
A narrow, rocky boundary separated the two. This boundary,
or rather partition, as well as the sides of the spring,
was apparently a silicious deposit or petrifaction caused by
the water itself. On going up near the margin, and walking
round on every side, I noticed that the earth or rock
overhung the springs on all sides, so I could see directly
under, and the crust near the margin was very thin, giving
it a most awful appearance. If one should approach too
near the margin, and it should break off, down he would go
to inevitable death in the seething cauldron. It is said, if a
man is born to be hanged he can never be drowned. Of
course a like immunity attends such a man if he is in danger
of being boiled! I should rather meet the fate of Empedocles,
and save my boots! A person might very easily run
splash into these springs, or rather this double spring, for it is
just even full of water, and on level ground. I did not see it
till I was just on the margin. Some late traveler here said
his guide repeatedly ran across the narrow rocky partition
that separated the two. Had he fallen in, whatever might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>be the temperature of the future world that he would be
destined to go to, he would never require another hot bath
in this. The guide now showed me the Strokr, or what Sir
John Stanley calls the New Geyser. It is a mere hole in
the ground, like a well, without a basin or raised margin.
It is nine feet in diameter at the top, and gradually grows
smaller to about five feet in diameter. The Strokr—a word
signifying agitator—is a most singular spring. I looked
down into it, and saw the water boiling violently about
twenty feet below the surface of the ground. It is situated
131 yards south of the Great Geyser. While looking at
this, I heard a noise, and looking up saw a burst of water
and steam a little way off, that the guide said was the Little
Geyser. It is 106 yards south of the Strokr. I went to it,
and found an irregular but voluminous burst of water, rising
with considerable noise, eight or ten feet high. It played
about five minutes, and stopped. I found that it played in
a similar way at pretty regular intervals of about half an
hour, throughout the day. About noon, some two hours
after the first alarm, I heard again the signal-guns of the
big Geyser. The discharges were near a dozen, following
one another in quick succession, sounding like the firing of
artillery at sea, at the distance of two or three miles. I ran
up to the Geyser, and saw the water in a state of violent
agitation, and soon it rose six or eight feet, in a column or
mass, directly over the pipe. It, however, soon subsided, and
the water in the basin, from being full and running over,
sank down the pipe till the basin became nearly empty. I
was doomed to disappointment this time, there being no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>more eruption than this. It was two or three hours before
the basin got full of water again. About four o’clock I
heard the reports again, and louder than before; the guide
hallooed to me, and we ran up near the margin of the basin.
The explosions continued, perhaps, two minutes, the water
becoming greatly agitated, filling the basin to overflowing,
and then, as if the earth was opening, the fountain burst
forth with a shock that nearly threw me over. The water
shot in one immense column from the whole size of the
pipe, and rose perpendicularly, separating a little into different
streams as it ascended. Such a spectacle no words
can describe. Its height, as near as I could judge, was
about 70 or 75 feet. The awful noise, as a renewal of the
forces kept the water in play, seemed as if a thousand engines
were discharging their steam-pipes up through a pool
of boiling water. Great quantities of steam accompanied
it, but not enough to hide the column of water. We stood
in perfect safety within forty feet of the fountain all the
time it was playing, which was about six or eight minutes.
Well was it said that, had Louis XIV. of France seen the
Geysers of Iceland, he never would have made the fountains
of Versailles. Compare the work of man, when he
makes a spurting jet from a pipe with a two inch bore, to a
column of boiling water ten feet in diameter, and near a
hundred feet high, and rushing up with the noise and actual
force of a volcano! Fiddle-de-dee! As well put a
boy’s pop-gun beside of one of Paixhan’s sixty-four pounders.
I had thought that Niagara Falls was the greatest
curiosity, and Fingal’s Cave, at Staffa, the most pleasing one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>that I had ever seen; but—though not at all alike—the
great Geyser of Iceland, as a marvellous work of nature,
eclipses them both. Give a Barnum the power of a Prospero,
and let him gather together, in one place, the Mammoth
Cave of Kentucky, Niagara Falls, the Natural Bridge
in Virginia, Fingal’s Cave, and the Great Geyser, and get a
fence built round them. Fury! What a show-shop he
could open! Well, after all, it is a happy thing that the
great curiosities of the world are pretty well distributed over
the earth’s surface. The Geyser played lower and lower,
and in the course of two or three minutes after it began to
recede, had all sunk down into the pipe, leaving the basin
quite empty, and the pipe also down for about ten feet.
This was the first time I had an opportunity of looking into
the pipe. The water was scarcely agitated at all, but slowly
rising. In the course of two and a half hours the basin was
again full and overflowing. According to the most reliable
estimates, the maximum height of the eruptions of the Great
Geyser is from 90 to 100 feet. Olafsen and Povelsen, two
Icelandic writers who flourished near a hundred years ago,
estimated the height to be 360 feet; evidently a great exaggeration.
Some have attempted to prove by mathematics
and the law of projectiles that water cannot by any
force or power be thrown in a stream over 95 or 96 feet high.
Fire-engines disprove this, but at any rate that seems to be
about the height of the highest jets of the Great Geyser.
Sir John Stanley, in 1789, calculated the height by a quadrant,
of the highest eruption that he saw, at 96 feet. Dr.
Hooker estimated it at 100, and Sir George Mackenzie at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>90 feet. The first account of these remarkable fountains
dates back about 600 years. To me, one of the most remarkable
circumstances connected with Iceland is, the constant
and regular supply of fire that keeps springs of water
at a boiling heat, and sends forth fountains with a force beyond
all human power, and with a constant and unceasing
regularity, for hundreds, and, for aught we know to the contrary,
for thousands of years. Whence is the supply of
fuel? Why does it not all get consumed? But a child
can ask a question that a man cannot answer. Some have
attempted by drawings and illustrations to figure out a
theory of pipes, cavities, and conduits under the earth, that,
supplied with a constant stream of hot water, would produce
the eruptions that we see. The great irregularity in time
and in force seems to set at naught the wisest calculations.
We can see the effect produced, and can look on
and admire, but the springs of action are hid by the Almighty
in the wonderful laboratory of nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the poet spoke of his blood boiling like “the
springs of Hekla,” he undoubtedly meant the Geysers. A
man’s blood would be in a state of violent commotion if it
equalled the activity displayed by the <em>Strokr</em>, or his
brother the Great Geyser. The <em>Strokr</em> is little less remarkable
or interesting than the Great Geyser. Though of less
magnitude, it throws its stream of water higher, and wider
too, and more varied, in consequence of its rather irregular
bore. This bore, or pipe, is somewhat rough and a little
crooked, like the Irishman’s gun, made for “shooting
round a corner.” One rule seems to pervade all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Geysers or shooting springs of Iceland. The larger they
are, the more seldom their eruptions. The Great Geyser,
from what I can learn, does not give one of its highest
eruptions oftener than once in one or two days, the <em>Strokr</em>
once or twice a day generally, and the Little Geyser every
thirty or forty minutes. The <em>Strokr</em> can be made to erupt
by throwing in stones or turf. The former sometimes
choke it up, but turf and sods do not; and moreover they
produce a fine effect by giving a black, inky appearance to
the water. I had my guide cut up a quantity of turf with
a spade, and, piling them up on the margin, we threw
them—several bushels at a time—down the well of the
<em>Strokr</em>. They splashed in the water, which was boiling
furiously, as usual, about twenty feet below the top. The
ebullition nearly ceased, and we watched it with great
interest for some little time, but no eruption seemed to
come at the call we had made. We walked away a few
steps, thinking that this method of producing an eruption
was not infallible, when suddenly it shot forth with a
tremendous explosion, throwing its column of dirty water
an immense height. As near as I could judge, the water
ascended just about one hundred and thirty feet. The
explosive, or, rather, eruptive force was not quite as regular
as in the Great Geyser, but would momentarily slacken,
and be renewed, the height of the column sometimes not
being over seventy or eighty feet high. How black and
inky the water looked! and occasionally pieces of turf
were seen flying high in the air. I know not how it was,
but after the first surprise was over, I had a most irresistible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>propensity to laugh; and, considering it a very
innocent exercise, I indulged it. After playing about
fifteen minutes, it began to slacken, and gradually settled
down. It took some time, however, to get over its “black
vomit,” caused by the turf and earth that we administered.
After dropping below the surface, and sinking down into
the pipe, up ’twould come again; and, as the water would
reach the surface of the ground, it would seem to burst and
shoot not only high but wide. The falling water wet the
earth for some twenty or thirty feet from the pipe. I
picked up some small fragments of the grass turf that we
had thrown in, and found them literally cooked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some twenty years ago a horse fell into one of the mud
springs here at the Geysers, and never was seen afterwards.
Poor pony! to be boiled in seething mud was a worse
punishment than Falstaff met with when he was pitched into
Datchett mead. In the northern part of Iceland, an ox fell
into a Geyser, and after he was fairly cooked he was blown
out by an eruption. Whether he was served up at a
banquet afterwards, I have not been able to learn. The
pieces of turf that were thrown out of the <em>Strokr</em> looked
more like pieces of seal-skin than they did like turf. It
was enough to alter the appearance of anything, a boiling
of ten minutes in this infernal cauldron. There is a singular
cave, about a mile in extent, a day’s journey north of
Thingvalla, that the Icelanders call <em>Surtshellir</em>, or Cave of
Surtar (Satan)—in English, the Devil’s Cave. No Icelandic
guide will ever go into it. When travelers explore
it they must go alone. They believe it is the habitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>his satanic majesty; and that when he comes above
ground to set the world on fire, he will come up out of this
cave. I wonder if he don’t come to the Geysers sometimes
to cook his dinner. He might indulge in what Pope calls a
feast of “infernal venison.” In that case he probably
catches a wild reindeer—of which there are plenty in the
island—and bakes him on Mount Hekla, instead of taking
the witty poet’s bill of fare, “a roasted tiger, stuffed with
tenpenny nails”!</p>

<p class='c013'>Though the <em>Strokr</em> plays once or twice every day,
of its own accord, yet I took a malicious pleasure in
provoking it to a “blow out;” and a few hours after the
first, I asked the guide to give it another dose of turf. He
looked into it, and seeing the boiling rather feeble, said it
was no use; it had not yet received strength for another
effort. Still he tried it, and we waited to see it “go on a
bu’st”! It would not; but about two hours afterwards it
exploded, and we saw another grand eruption, similar
to the first. Our sensations are altogether different in
looking at these works of nature, from what they are at
seeing an artificial fountain, however brilliant. In the
latter case we know the power that propels the water, but
here we look on and wonder at the unseen power that for
hundreds of years keeps these marvellous fountains in
operation. It would be a problem worth solving to see
how far a shaft or excavation in the vicinity of those springs
could be carried in a perpendicular direction, before finding
water or earth that should be so hot as to stop the progress
of the works. Hot springs are scattered all over Iceland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to the number of thousands, and at nearly every step you
see lava, volcanoes, or extinct craters. Seeing the constant
proofs of subterranean heat, as developed in the hot springs,
it cannot be doubted that heat, if not actual fire, would be
found at a short distance below the surface, in most any
part of the country. A truce to speculation. I hope the
day is not far distant, when experiments and investigations
of a scientific character shall be made by men of learning,
in different parts of this extraordinary country.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are two or three farm-houses in the vicinity, and
near one of them, in a hot spring, I saw a large iron kettle
placed, and in it were clothes boiling. Indeed, if these
hot springs were movable property, would they not be
worth something attached to a large hotel or bathing
establishment? I boiled a piece of meat for my dinner
in one of the springs, and while the culinary operation
was going on, I went to a pool in the brook that flows
from the Great Geyser, and had a most delicious warm
bath. ’Twas all gratis—no charge for heating the water.
The brooks that flow from the Geysers all retain their heat
more or less for several hundred yards, until they are
swallowed up in the icy cold river into which they empty.
Some travelers have spoken of a sulphury taste to meat
boiled in the Geysers, but I did not observe it. A good
many birds were all day flying about the Geysers. They
were the <em>tern</em> or sea-swallow, a bird very common in
Iceland, both on the seashore and inland. The Icelanders
call them the <em>cree</em>. This bird is common in England, but I
never remember to have seen them in America. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>light, elegant, and graceful creatures they are on the wing!
Their flight is as light and easy as that of the butterfly; in
motion, as swift as a swallow, and as graceful as a seagull.
They are about the size of the pigeon, with very long
wings and a forked tail, like the barn swallow. They are
nearly white, with a slight blue shade, like the clear sky;
just like that delicate cerulean tinge that the ladies like to
give their white handkerchiefs. They kept up a constant
cry or scream that was not unpleasant, and often flew so
near us that I could see their eyes. I climbed to the top
of the hill that is just west of the Geysers, and found
it higher than I had anticipated. It looks low in comparison
with the high mountain, the <em>Bjarnarfell</em>, that
is back of it. It is composed of lava, slags, scoriæ, volcanic
sand, &amp;c. The back side of it is very precipitous; about
perpendicular. This hill is called Laugarfjall (pronounced
<em>La-gar-fe-at-l</em>), or hot spring mountain. Between this and
the Bjarnarfell is a small river flowing through green
meadows. I should have been glad to have ascended the
larger mountain, but had not time without running the risk
of missing an eruption of the Great Geyser. I gathered
some fine specimens of the petrifactions formed by the
water, by breaking them up from the bottom of the brook
a short distance from the basin. In appearance they much
resemble the heads of cauliflower; in color, nearly white.
The incrustations are far more beautiful a little way from
the fountain head than in the basin itself, as the silicious
deposit is made principally as the water cools. I noticed
that grass grew over a portion of the ground among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>numerous hot springs; but near the sources of them there is
evidently too much heat, there being nothing but bare
earth around them. There are no springs of cold water in
the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c013'>But night has arrived, and I must depart. Though
I had seen all of these remarkable fountains in active play, I
was reluctant to leave them. I turned my steps towards
the humble cottage of the peasant of Haukadalr, for
another night’s rest before starting south to see Mount
Hekla.</p>

<p class='c013'>O<span class='fsvs'>UR</span> pleasant stay at the Geysers was finished, the last
look taken; the last piece of bacon that we had boiled in
Dame Nature’s cauldron, had disappeared; the farmer of
Haukadalr had given us his good benediction and a hearty
grip of the hand, while he pocketed the dollars that we
gave him; and, our ponies being ready, we prepared to
leave. The old raven, too,—for here in Iceland “the raven
croaks him on the chimney top,” as he did when and
where Richard the III. was born,—the old raven had
croaked out his farewell. There is no blinking the matter;
we have to face it. Mount Hekla is in the distance, and
visit it we must. It was two days journey there, and several
terrible rivers lay in the route; but hospitable Icelanders
lived on the way, and the soft plank floors of orthodox
church “hotels” invite the traveler to spread down his
blanket and repose. Reader, just glance at a map of Iceland,
such a one as Mr. G<span class='fsvs'>UNNLAUGSONN</span>’<span class='fsvs'>S</span>—but you haven’t
got one; then put one “in your mind’s eye,” or imagine
yourself in a balloon about “these parts,” and see what a
tract of country we have to travel through.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>To the north, just about the center of Iceland, the
ranges of the Lang Jokull and Hofs Jokull lift their heads
and show their crowns of perpetual snow; to the east lies
Skaptar Jokull, once terrible, in an eruption the most
devastating that ever occurred, but now hushed in grim
repose, and covered with a snow-white blanket. Far to the
south is Mount Hekla, with a slight bit of snow near the
top, and rearing its burning summit near six thousand feet
above the level of the sea. Encircled by these mountains
is a valley, the most extensive tract of fertile land in Iceland,
and drained by its largest rivers. Behind us lay the
Bruará, and next was the Arbrandsá; but the Hvitá (<em>Wheet-ow</em>),
the Laxá, and the Thjorsá, are far the largest, the last
more than 150 miles in length, and draining the extensive
glaciers of the Hofs and Skaptar Jokulls. These rivers
flow in a southwestern direction, emptying into the Atlantic
between the Westmann Islands and Cape Reykjanes.
We dashed into the Arbrandsá, and were through it in a
hurry, our ponies making light of the three feet of water
and a swift current. Don’t ask us how we fared. The rain
over head, and the rivers, lakes, and hot springs, had made
us amphibious before this, about as effectually as if we had
been born otters or sea-gulls. What a splendid meadow
we pass through, here in the beautiful valley of the Hvitá!
Here the “mower whets his scythe;” and such a scythe!—about
two feet long and an inch wide, hung on a straight
snath. But don’t he cut the grass clean to the turf? He
shaves it down as close as some men reap their chins—those
that shave at all, I mean—“let the galled jade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>wince,” our beard is uncut. But we were speaking of an
Iceland meadow. How can grass grow in Iceland? you
ask. Why, right out of the ground; for the soil, though
shallow, is quite fertile. An Iceland meadow looks very
much like a good pasture when nothing has been in it for
some six weeks: grass thick, green, and soft; but very little
of it running up to seed. The grass looks like our “red
top.” White clover would do well, undoubtedly, if they
would sow it. Almost every Icelander unites the occupations
of farmer and fisherman. In June he goes to sea “to
fish for cod,” and in July and August cuts and secures his
hay. This is a very important operation with the Icelander,
for without hay his animals would die in the winter.
The hay is fed to the sheep and cattle; the horses have to
do without. How a race of animals like the horse manage
to live without a particle of attention, shelter, or food, for a
long Iceland winter, except just what they can get out of
doors, is more than we can divine. Guess they’re used to
it! They eat the dead grass, often having to paw away
the snow to get it; they go on the mountains, gather moss,
browse the stunted shrubbery; and when driven from the
fields and the mountains, they go down on the sea-shore
and pick up sea-weed. When badly pushed with hunger,
they will eat fish bones, offal, scraps of leather, wood, heath,
and shrubbery, and almost every thing but earth and stones.
Still, they very seldom die. They seem hardened by the
climate, and fitted to endure the changing seasons as they
roll. In winter they get reduced to skeletons, mere skin
and bones; but towards the last of May, when the grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>begins to grow, it is surprising how quick they get fat.
Every horse in our troop is literally fat, and no oats did
they ever eat; neither have they swallowed the barrel, for
you can’t see the hoops on their sides! Were you to offer
any grain to an Iceland horse, he would not know what
you meant, and undoubtedly would think you joking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tell John Gossin, if Tom Spring had been an Iceland
pony, Deaf Burke never would have kicked him “where
he put his oats.” Of course the horses in the towns that
are worked, are fed in the winter. The hay being cut and
dried is tied up in large bundles and “toted” off on men’s
backs to the stack-yard. If the distance is long, they sling
large bundles each side of a pony’s back, and he carries it
off. And big loads they will carry; a pony thus loaded
looks like a moving hay-stack. The farmer makes a square
yard, walls of stone, and turf, and this he fills with long,
low stacks, which he covers with long strips of turf cut up
from the surface of a tough bog grass-field; and when the
stack remains over a second summer, this turf grows, and
an Iceland settlement presents the curious appearance of
houses, stone walls, and hay-stacks covered with green grass
like the meadows and pastures on every side.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scythes, spades, small rakes with teeth about an inch
and a half long, pitchforks and ropes, are all the tools an
Icelander uses on his farm. His ropes are made of wool,
braided, or wool and hair mixed, the manes and tails of
the horses being laid under contribution for the latter article.
At the farm of Haukadalr, this traveler astonished
the natives considerably, by taking hold of a scythe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>showing them that he could mow. Leaving the fine farm
and meadows, we crossed a long stream of lava—a high
bleak ridge—and soon reached the bank of the White
River, along which we traveled for several miles. Here,
for the first time in Iceland, we saw the red-headed pochard
(<em>fuligula rufina</em>), the most beautiful of all the duck tribe.
This bird, naturalists inform us, is found in North America,
near to the Arctic circle, in Europe south, as far as Italy,
and east, to the Himalaya mountains in Asia; a pretty wide
range for one sweet bird. The pair we saw showed the
spirit of ancient Romans by manifesting an unconquerable
hatred for <em>Nero</em>, our traveling companion. They doubtless
had a nest; for they chased us for miles, and when they got
tired of chasing the dog, he would chase them. As beautiful
as these birds were, had we carried a gun, it is barely
possible that an invitation might have been extended to
these pretty creatures to come down and dine with us.
Blessed birds: of course I was not so unfeeling as to wish
to hurt them!</p>

<p class='c013'>The pochard is a bird that lives on inland waters, not at
sea. His head and neck are reddish brown, with a rich
gloss, a “collar” round the neck; back and throat black;
other parts brown, white, and mottled. It is about the size
of the canvas-back duck. One species of pochard has a
beautiful crest of feathers adorning the top of its head.
Soon after the pair of birds left us, we saw three or four
more. We traveled several miles down the right bank of
the Hvitá, and a magnificent river it is. Twice the size of
the Hudson at Poughkeepsie, confined between high banks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>it rushes its milky-looking flood onwards to the ocean.
Indeed, this is a terrible stream.</p>

<p class='c013'>The banks of the Hvitá, for several miles, are from 100
to 150 feet high, and perpendicular. What an explosion
there must have been when that crack burst in the lava,
and formed the chasm where the river flows! The stream,
too, has undoubtedly worn it much deeper than it was at
first. And how swift the river runs! Where will streams
be swift, if not on mountainous islands? The water, too,
like milk; perhaps the snow colors it! Some have dived
a little deeper for the cause, and contend the clay on the
mountains colors it. We finally emerged on to a broad
plain; and here, near the church and farm of Bræthratunga,
the high banks became lower, and we prepared to cross.
From certain ominous hints thrown out by the guide, I
made up my mind for a swim. The river was nearly a mile
wide, but the current was broken by several low islands.
We tightened girths, placed the baggage as near on the
top of the horses’ backs as possible, and rode in. The first
island was gained easily enough, the water not exceeding
three feet deep. The next channel was a turbulent and
fearful-looking torrent. In we plunged, and as ill luck
would have it, my pony was the lowest one of the lot—scarcely
twelve hands high. The others were over their
backs in the water, and mine went a little lower down the
stream, got out of his depth, and away we went down the
river. My head and shoulders were out of water, but
nothing could be seen of the poor pony except his nose
and the tip of his ears. I stuck to him like a kingfisher to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>a black bass, but let him “gang his ain gait,” and he pulled
for the island. Had it not been a long one, and extended
well down the stream, we should have missed it, and gone
out to sea, or else to Davy Jones’ locker. But we struck
the lower end of it, and just saved ourselves. Though I
have not experienced cold weather nor snow here, there is
one thing that is cold in Iceland, and that is, the milky-looking
water in the turbulent rivers. It was a little the
coldest bath I ever took. The white pony did the swimming,
and he swam like a good fellow, or I should have
jumped off and tried my own flippers. The dog, too, had
a hard time of it. Poor Nero, he did not find his swim as
comfortable as his imperial namesake used to in a Roman
bath. He swam after us, but the current carried him so
swiftly away that he got below the point of the island, and
I thought he must be lost. The poor dog howled in despair,
and turned back. He was a noble animal, and I
really commiserated his unfortunate situation, for he was
beyond any help from us. By hard swimming he gained
the shallow water, and got back to the island we last left.
Now, look at the sagacity of a dog. He saw he must come
to us, or be left the west side of the river, near a hundred
miles from home. So he went clear to the upper end of
the island, and started again. The diagonal course that his
swimming and the current took him, just lodged him on the
lower end of the island, where we were. The next two
channels were wide, but not deep, and we forded them
without difficulty; and after about three-quarters of an
hour, we climbed up the eastern bank of the stream. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>were now about ten miles northeast of Skalholt, that apocryphal
capital of Iceland. I saw a beautiful red flower
growing on one of the islands in this river, and I stopped
and gathered some seeds. Perhaps they will add one to
our floral variety in America.</p>

<p class='c013'>My swim did me no damage—the rain for some days
past having seasoned me, so that, like the skinned eels, I
was used to it. Be it here recorded for the benefit of poor,
erring, and sinful man, the slave of habit, fashion’s minion,
Plato’s biped without feathers—all erring mortals who mar
what God hath made, those who scrape their faces with
villainous steel, those who doff Dame Nature’s garb, and
find no substitute—all these, and any others, if such there
be, are informed that this wanderer has never once
“caught cold,” not the slightest, since this “beard” of
mine had six weeks’ pith. And this with the damp fogs
of England, steamboating in the Baltic, coasting by Norway,
“schoonering” in the Arctic sea, camping out in Iceland,
swimming the cold rivers, sleeping on the ground,
climbing snowy mountains, and various “moving accidents
by flood and field,”—this is saying something for nearly
three years’ experience of throwing away the razor. But I
see how it is, my friends will never know what a “magnificent
Turk” I am, until I get my phiz engraved—brass on
wood!—or else put in “dagger o’ type;” and this will emphatically
say to all my miserable, chin-shaven brethren,
Go and do likewise. Ahem, where was I? On the east
bank of the White River, shivering with the effects of a
cold bath. A broad tract of lava was our road, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>vegetable life for a long distance, save the heath that appeared
here and there, now in full bloom. A few hours’
ride, part of it through a good farming country, brought
us to Hruni. In various directions on our route, we saw
the steam of hot springs rising up. Hruni is not a large
town. It contains a church, a farm, and the residence of
the clergyman. Indeed, I was glad to see a friendly roof.
It had rained for hours, and though the rain had warmed
the ice-water, still ’twas <em>wet</em>. I felt as if a log cabin would
have been a palace; but here was a house, a good one, a
framed building with a wooden roof. Never was hospitality
more welcome, nor was it ever extended more freely. It was
about three o’clock, and we had been in our saddles since
nine, and a long, rough, and wet time we had had of it.
The clergyman, Herre Johann Briem, one of nature’s noblemen,
indeed, gave me a hearty welcome. He set before me
bread, butter, cheese, coffee, milk; and a most capital bottle
of port wine he uncorked. I shall not tell how many
glasses of it went under my jacket before I left. Indeed,
I never counted them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Briem was physically one of the finest men I have
ever seen. At least six feet three inches high, and well-proportioned,
he would have been a striking figure among
the grenadiers of Frederick the Great. The house had
good furniture, and a fine library covered one wall of his
parlor. Here I saw, for the first time in Iceland, the “<em>Antiquitates
Americanæ</em>,” a work issued by the Society of
Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen, giving the full account
of the “Ante-Columbian Discovery of America.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Admiring a little book in Mr. Briem’s library, a volume of
the “<em>Northurfari</em>,” an Icelandic Annual for 1849, he very
politely made me a present of it. I felt ashamed at accepting
it; but I could do no otherwise, though I had
nothing, not the slightest thing about me, either English or
American, that I could present him in return. A fine intellect
beamed from Mr. Briem’s countenance, and his hospitalities
were as graceful as his person was comely. He
showed me a splendidly printed volume, a large octavo
Danish and Icelandic Dictionary.</p>

<p class='c013'>I can inform the old Austrian dame—that Madame Trollope,
the conceited Ida Pfeiffer—that all the Iceland clergymen
I met, were as hospitable as Mr. Briem. Some of the
very same clergymen who entertained her, also opened their
houses to me; and not a penny of compensation could I
ever get them to take, although she most falsely states they
received her money for entertaining her. This is the woman
that runs all over the world, and writes books about
what she sees, and much that she does not see; and because
the governor of Iceland would not be bored by her shallow
Highness, then she pens all manner of false and libelous
stories of the most kind, hospitable, unoffending race of
people that the sun shines upon. The best comment that
can be made on her book is, that she describes her journey
to Mt. Hekla, and <em>ascent to the summit</em>, when the people
here on the ground told me she never put her foot on the
mountain at all!</p>

<p class='c013'>A<span class='fsvs'>LL</span> pleasant sojourns must end; all oases must fade in
the distance as we journey o’er the desert sands of life.
Though it rained hard, an hour after I stopped with “mine
host,” the intelligent clergyman of Hruni, we were in our
saddles, and the white, the black, and the chestnut ponies
were scampering “over the hills and far away.” The farmer
of Haukadalr left us here, and Mr. Briem sent one of
his farm servants to show us the way. It is two pretty
good days’ ride from the Geysers to Hekla; and we had yet
two large rivers to cross, and sundry mountains, valleys,
lava-beds, and green fields to go over or get round, before
we were half way to the celebrated volcano. Near the
house we passed a very large spring of limpid water that
looked most deliciously tempting for a swim. Getting
off my horse, I tried the temper of it, and found it 96°
of Fahrenheit, just comfortable for a warm bath. Our
route took us across the Laxá, a broad, shallow river; and
here were some of the best farms I had seen in Iceland.
The white clover was here, the first I had seen of it, and
the meadows evidently produced nearly or quite double the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>hay that those did which were seeded down with the native
grass alone. The blooming clover whitening the fields gave
the land a fine appearance, and half made me think I was
back home again. A forest of maple and beech trees would
have completed the illusion. I saw here, as I did in other
places, caraway growing spontaneously in the fields; and
it was as tall, as finely-flavored, and as well-seeded as you
find it with us. It is not indigenous here; but some being
brought to Iceland and planted, it has propagated itself
over a good portion of the cultivated parts of the island.
The same is true of the white clover.</p>

<p class='c013'>The meadow lands in Iceland are rough in surface, just
in a state of nature, not one acre in ten thousand ever having
had the turf broken. They are not plowed and “seeded
down,” but get seeded and grassed over by nature. As I
have mentioned, there is not a plow or a harrow in the
whole country. The garden spots round the houses seldom
exceed the sixteenth part of an acre, and they are dug up
with a spade. The angelica—<em>angelica archangelica</em>—the
same that grows in our wet meadows in America, is here
grown and used as a salad. It is a native of Iceland. With
us it is reputed poisonous; but here I have eaten it, and
think it has a very pleasant taste. Many a boy in our northern
States has made a <em>flute</em> out of an “angelica stalk;” but
probably few of them ever ate it afterwards, or thought of
applying the Highland proverb to it, “Here’s baith meat
and music, quoth the dog when he ate the piper’s bag.”
Every thing in Iceland seems to go by contraries, the angelica
and “red-top” grass, and other of our aquatic and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>swamp plants, flourishing everywhere, on dry as well as
on wet soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>The peasant soon returned, leaving us pursuing our way
south. In the valley of the Laxá the lava is seen in great
variety of color. Much of it is in high, red hills, as bright
as if it had been painted. Some of it is black, and some
brown. The red was the softest and most porous.
Some of the hilly river-banks were crumbling down like
slate cliffs, but a near view showed them to be lava. A few
miles travel brought us to the banks of the Thiorsá, a
mighty river, far larger than any we had seen, and I believe
the largest in Iceland. It comes from near the interior of
the island, and cannot be much less than 200 miles long.
It drains the waters that flow from the glaciers of Hekla,
Hofs Jokull, Skaptar Jokull, Vatna Jokull, and Torfa Jokull.
A profile view of this river, as laid down on the large
map of Iceland, shows the highest branches of it to be
3,000 feet above the level of the sea; half as high as Mt.
Hekla.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here was a ferry, the first we had seen. The Thiorsá is
nearly three-quarters of a mile wide here; and its depth—I
believe I will not tell how deep it is—ask the great northern
diver, for he may have been to the bottom of it: I have
not. The farmer-ferryman and his son left their hay-field,
and in a stout skiff rowed us across. The horses were tied
together in a string, the nose of one to the tail of another;
and the guide sat in the stern of the boat, and led the forward
one. The poor ponies had hard work in swimming the
cold river, and seemed to suffer some. They tried hard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>get into the boat, but that would have shipwrecked us inevitably.
The powerful current threw us a long distance
down the river before we landed on the south side. The
boatman charged me half a dollar, Danish, about thirty
cents; cheap enough certainly for his fatigue and danger.
At eight o’clock we arrived at the farm and church of
Skarth, where we tarried all night. The clergyman of the
parish does not live here, but the obliging farmer did every
thing he could to make me comfortable. I think I stated
that I had arrived at the dignity of sleeping under the
bed. That is a luxury that until lately has only been accorded
to princes. The eider-down bed, from the Iceland
eider-duck, has long been noted for its lightness and softness.
It is perhaps the greatest non-conductor of heat that
can be used as a covering. It is altogether too warm. A
down bed a foot thick looks as if it would smother you
when put on top of the bed, but its perceptible weight is
nothing. I usually kicked off this down covering long
before morning, for it is impervious to all the insensible
perspiration, and consequently in less than half an hour
the sleeper finds himself perspiring profusely. I sometimes
put the down bed under me, and used my Highland
plaid for a covering. The unhealthiness of down beds has
been discovered, and kings and nobles have ceased, in a
great measure, to use them; and consequently the price of
down has greatly fallen, and now every peasant can afford
to have a bed of down. Here I slept in a church for the
first time. Learning that it was customary for travelers
in Iceland, I had no scruples at sleeping under the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>roof with the church mice. As we are all destined to take
a long sleep some day in a church yard, or somewhere
else, I thought I might as well begin now, try it by degrees,
and see how I liked it. I did not know but the rapping
ghost of old Thor with his sledge hammer would rap
confusion into my noddle, after his usual Iceland style of
“thunder in the winter;” but I was not disturbed. I slept
perfectly sound, till the sun was high in heaven. The
green mounds around the church looked as peaceful, and
no doubt the spirits of the dead were as quiet in heaven, as
if no Sassenach had been here to disturb their slumbers.
A good reason why old Thor did not disturb me. He is a
heathen deity, and totally indifferent to any use whatever
that churches may be put to. Perhaps, were I to go into
one of his caves without reverently laying my shoes aside,
and offering up my guide as a sacrifice, he might jump out
of the crater of Hekla, and hit me a rap that would give
my “daylights” their exit, or knock me where the sun
never sets. I gave the farmer a dollar, for milk, cream,
horse-pasture, and church-rent, and for the first time got a
hearty Iceland salute. Throwing his arms round my neck
he gave me a smack that fairly echoed from the surrounding
hills.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Skarth, the Eyjafjalla and Tindfjalla Jokulls show
their broad, snowy sides and summits; but Hekla is the
most conspicuous. The whole mountain, near to the top, is
black. Near the summit there are some spots of snow that
extend more or less down the north side, while a curling
wreath of smoke on the apex reveals the existence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>fire within. We started directly towards the mountain,
with the farmer for our guide. On every side of Hekla, as
far as we could see, much of the ground was covered with
black lava. The land over which we rode here was covered
with lava and volcanic sand, and, what is seldom seen in
such a situation, tufts of grass grew here and there. Heath
is nearly the first vegetation that finds root on the lava.
Here, in a pasture near a river, we saw a splendid lot of
horses. What a wild, untamed look they had; sleek and
fat, with long, flowing tails and manes! They appeared
like the flock that crossed the path of Mazeppa. The Iceland
farmers usually keep great numbers of horses, and
there is no country in the world where they can be raised
so cheaply. And they sell these animals cheap. I saw a
beautiful, jet black, four-year old, at the Geysers, an entire
horse, that had never been saddled. His form was symmetry
itself. He was just about twelve and a half hands high.
I asked the price—less than ten dollars, our money. In
Boston or New York he would bring $150 or $200. We
crossed the Vestri Rangá, a small stream, and arrived about
the middle of the afternoon at Næfrholt, the last farm and
the last green spot this side of Hekla. The farmer was from
home; and our farmer from Skarth, who had accompanied
us, started off after him. He had not got far before down
he came, thrown by his horse, or rather falling off, for I
could see nothing to bring him out of the saddle. Perhaps
Mr. Cogniac Brandy, or somebody else, had put a “brick”
in his hat. He was a big, beefy fellow, and fell tumbling
down like a meal-sack. I thought he must be killed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>ran to help him; but he was up in a jiffy, and under full
gallop in less than a minute, vaulting into his saddle on the
off side at that. It takes an Icelander, to fall and not hurt
him. I rather think this one would tumble down Mount
Hekla and never bruise his shins. The farmer came home,
and told us we could put up at his house; and then the
Skarth farmer returned to his home. This was the first
really pleasant evening I had seen during my journey, and
it bid fair for a clear day on the morrow. Unless it were
so, it would be useless to attempt the ascent of Hekla, and
expect to see any thing. I took the guide, and climbed to
the top of a steep mountain, one of several about a thousand
feet high that skirt the base of Hekla, and seemed to
stand as sentries near their fiery and warlike monarch.
Here the recollection of my boyish days and boyish sports
came up, and I felt like having a little fun. There was a
grand chance for rolling stones down hill, and we improved
it. After setting off a number of different sizes, we noticed
a ponderous boulder partly buried in the earth. It looked
as if it could be moved. It was nearly round, and would
weigh five or six tons. I called the guide to help me push
it off, but he looked ominously at the house far on the plain
below. I convinced him that it could not go there; and
then he showed me the farmer’s wall, a beautiful dyke of
stones and turf that separated the meadow below from the
mountain pasture. I told him I would pay all damage; and
we got behind it. With our backs to the mountain, and
feet against it, we crowded it out of its bed. It fell with an
awful crash through about a hundred feet of jagged rocks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>nearly perpendicular, and then took the sloping plain below.
But didn’t it streak it? The ground fairly smoked.
The surface was smooth sand and gravel, and within thirty
or thirty-five degrees of the perpendicular. Lower down,
the grass began to grow. The rock took a bee-line for two
or three hundred yards, till near the bottom, when it commenced
a series of flights of “ground and lofty tumbling”
that would have done honor to Ducrow. One leap that I
measured was thirty-four feet, and there it struck the farmer’s
wall. It walked through it as if it had been a cobweb,
making a horrible gap near six feet wide, and moving one
stone that would weigh at least a ton. Well, it was capital
fun. The old rock curled round in a circuit, and rested in
the meadow. The farmer and his family ran out of the
house at the noise, and he came up to meet us. The guide
got a furious blowing up, all of which he took very coolly.
I ended the confab by paying him a dollar for the damage
done, and he went away quite satisfied. As I had had my
dance, it was all fair that I should pay the fiddler.</p>

<p class='c013'>The evening came on; as glorious a sunset as ever
gilded the tops of Arctic mountains. I retired early, hoping
in the morning to climb the rugged steep of Mount Hekla.</p>

<p class='c013'>H<span class='fsvs'>EIGHO</span> for Hekla! Thursday, July 29th, was a lofty one
in my calendar. The sun had many hours the start of us, getting
up as he does here at two o’clock in the morning. An
early hour, though, found us in our saddles. The morning
was magnificently bright, the mountain being visible, clear
to the curling wreath of smoke on the summit. Little
patches of snow, here and there near the top, made a break
in the broad, black streams of lava that covered every part
of the mountain. We provided ourselves with every requisite
for a long day’s journey. My knapsack was well stored
with good things—solids and fluids; and then I had my
old Scotch companion, the tartan plaid, to keep the cold
away; and each of us had a fine staff—what the Swiss
travelers call an Alpen stock, but ours were Hekla stocks,
Iceland staffs—some six feet long, and armed with a strong,
sharp, iron pike. My traveling guide, the farmer of
Næfrholt, and the reader’s most humble servant, made up
the party—not quite a princely retinue, but enough. Yes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and there was our dog, Nero. The top of the mountain was
distant about seven miles, of which we could ride nearly
four. Away we galloped through some fine green meadows,
till we came to a mountain gorge on our right, down
which in numerous cascades poured a small river. Several
ducks and water-hens flew away as we approached their
mountain home. Passing through this gorge, we came into
a circular meadow entirely shut in by mountains, like an immense
amphitheater, and this was the last bit of productive
land on our way towards the summit of Hekla. A hut
was erected here, as a temporary residence for the farmer
while gathering his hay. High, precipitous hills of red
lava overhung our path on the right, but the ascent for
some distance was gradual. For near a mile, we galloped
our horses over a gently ascending plain of fine volcanic
sand. High up the mountain side were several sheep, but
scarce a blade of grass could be seen where they stood.
Perhaps they went up to enjoy the prospect of the green
meadows far in the distance. We soon found our mountain
climbing was not going to be play. Our ponies found
it so too. Our route was intercepted by a broad and high
stream of lava that extended six or seven miles from the
summit of the mountain. We turned to the right in a
southerly direction, and for four or five hundred yards found
it about as steep as our ponies could climb. We took a
zig-zag course to relieve the animals, and after half an
hour’s climbing found ourselves on a level table-land, nearly
half a mile across. We were now about a thousand feet
above the lower region, where we left the farm house; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>here we were obliged to leave our horses. The Icelanders
have an ingenious way of fastening their animals so they
will not stray away. They fasten all their horses in a circle,
tying the head of one to the tail of another, and bringing
the head of the first round to the tail of the last. If
they choose to travel, they can; but like John on his rocking-horse,
they may gallop all day in one interminable circle,
and not get far. Near where we left the horses, extending
away to our right, was a large stream of lava—one that
came from the eruption of 1845; and though seven years
had elapsed, it was not yet cool, and smoke was rising from
it in many places. The “streams of lava” that run from
the craters of volcanoes, and which here in Iceland are
seen on the plains as well as on the mountains, are usually
from twenty to forty feet deep, from a hundred yards to
half a mile in breadth, and from one to ten miles long.
They are vast ridges of rough, black rocks, of a most forbidding
aspect, the largest masses weighing from one to
three or four tons. When it flows from the mountain, it is
a stream of molten mineral, and its progress generally
rather slow, but dependent on the steepness of the mountain,
and the size and the force of the stream. Melted lava
often does not move more than from fifty to one hundred
yards in a day, but in some cases it may run several miles. It
soon begins to explode and break up; by the expansion and
escape of the air within it, and by the force of the steam
created by moisture on the surface of the ground beneath.
While the lava is breaking up, for several days, it keeps
up a terrible roaring. Then this rough mass, as black as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>charcoal, lies unchanged in appearance for centuries. After
a long time, it begins to turn a little brown, and on its surface
appears in minute particles one of the lowest order of
mosses.</p>

<p class='c013'>The learned Spallanzani, Brydone, Dr. Holland, and
others who have investigated the subject, have all agreed
that there is no data on which a rule can be established, or
a judgment formed, as to the age of the lava. It is light
and porous, usually not more than half the specific gravity
of granite. Pumice, among other volcanic substances, is
lighter than water, and will float. Very old lavas are often
of a bright red color, and soft and light, having something
of the consistency of chalk. Much of the matter thrown
out of a volcano, at certain periods of the eruption, is in
the form of fine, black sand. We amused ourselves by rolling
some masses of old lava down a steep declivity into a
valley. It was very red, and so rotten that it broke into
innumerable pieces. Leaving our horses, we commenced
the ascent. While crossing a rough stream of lava, a mass,
weighing one or two tons, rolled as I stepped on it, and
threw me down, and I had a narrow escape from a severe
accident. I got off with a bruised shin, certainly not so
unpleasant a companion as a broken bone would be, especially
in a region like this, where there is not a skillful surgeon
within a thousand miles. Our ascent led up a valley,
having on our left the stream of lava aforesaid, and on our
right and before us a hill of volcanic sand. Into this our
feet sank deeply at every step. A half an hour brought us
to the steep front of the mountain, and now commenced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>ascent in real earnest. There was no bilking it; climb we
must. Up, up we went, like crows scaling Ben Nevis.
How the guides traveled so easy I could not tell. They
had a heavy knapsack and bottles of water and bottles of milk,
and I had nothing; but they tripped lightly along under
their burdens, while I found it hard work. At first I could
go ten or fifteen minutes without resting; but after an hour
or so I had to stop every five or six yards, throw myself on
the ground and recruit. Though nearly “tired to death,”
as boys say, yet in an astonishingly short space of time the
fatigue would vanish. Here the surface was volcanic sand—beaten
hard by the wind, apparently—and a good road
to travel on. There were fragments of lava—“slag” and
“scoriæ”—scattered over the ground. Some of these I
started down the mountain, but they were so rotten that
they broke into pieces before rolling a hundred yards. We
were getting between two and three thousand feet high,
nearly half way up the mountain; and yet vegetation had
not entirely ceased. Now and then, we could see a bit of
grass, and sometimes a very small plant. One tiny, yellow
flower, not bigger than a gold dollar, I gathered and put in
my pocket-book; and it proved to be the last flower that I
saw in going up. While stopping to rest, I found I had frequent
recourse to a certain glass thing that I carried—<em>vulgo
vocato</em>, a “pocket pistol”—but what it was charged
with is nothing to nobody! After about two hours hard
climbing, we arrived at the top of an eminence where I had
hoped we should at least see the summit of the mountain,
and that not far off; but we were yet a long distance from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>it; hills peeping o’er hills, and one peak rising above another.
The weather was beautiful; and, far to the west, we
could see the rivers with their green valleys, and beyond
them the snow-covered jokulls of the far north. To the
south we could see the Atlantic, though more than thirty
miles distant. But we must climb, and up, up we go. I
noticed here and there, among the dark-colored lava and
sand, a white-looking boulder, bearing evident marks of
fire; some the size of a cannon-shot, and some that would
weigh nearly half a ton. They were not granite, neither
were they chalk; but I could not break them or carry
away a specimen; so I had to be content with knowing
they were not ordinary lava, but still something that must
have been thrown out of the volcano. Our ascent grew
less precipitous, and we veered to the left, not going
directly towards the summit. At the height of about 4,000
feet, we first struck the snow. This was the first snow I
had trod since arriving in Iceland; and, as if the whole order
of nature must be reversed here, this snow was black.
This was not exactly the natural color, but a complexion it
had assumed from being so near the mouth of the volcano.
Sand, ashes, dust, and smoke had coated and begrimed
it so thoroughly that the whole surface was like fine charcoal.
A long valley was filled with it. As near as I could
judge, it was from five to fifty feet deep. We passed over
several snow-banks that were many hundred yards in
breadth, some of which had not lost their white color.
From the level country in the distance, these snow-banks
looked like mere patches, but here we found some of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>nearly a quarter of a mile across. We ascended the mountain
from the west, but now we were north of the summit,
and where most of the snow lay. Clouds now gathered
round us, and we had to grope our way in the fog for
some time. The ascent grew more precipitous, and the
climbing was exceedingly toilsome. The earth and lava
now appeared of a red color. We seemed to be approaching
the region of fire. Sulphurous fumes saluted our nostrils;
the weather cleared a little, and, suddenly, before us
yawned a deep crater. What a horrible chasm! Indeed,
it seemed like hell itself. Fire and brimstone literally.
Dark, curling smoke, yellow sulphur, and red cinders, appearing
on every side of it. The crater was funnel-shaped,
about 150 feet deep, and about the same distance across
at the top. This was one of four craters where the fire
burst out in 1845. After the eruption, they had caved in,
and remained as we now saw them. In a row above this
one, extending towards the top of the mountain, were three
other craters, all similar in appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our progress now was one of great danger. At our
left was the north side of the mountain; and for a long distance
it was a perpendicular wall, dropping off more than a
thousand feet below us. A large stone thrown over, never
sent back an echo. The craters were on our right, and
between these and the precipice on our left we threaded a
narrow ridge of sand, not wider than a common foot-path.
A more awful scene, or a more dangerous place I hope
never to be in. Had it not been for my long staff, I never
could have proceeded. The dangers and terrors of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>scene were greatly increased by the clouds and cold wind
that came up on our left, and the smoke and sulphurous
stench that rose from the craters on our right. One
moment in danger of falling over the perpendicular side of
the mountain on the one hand, and the next of being swallowed
up in the burning crater on the other. Our path
was exceedingly steep, and for nearly a quarter of a mile
we pursued it with slow and cautious steps. Old Nero
saw the danger, and set up a dismal howl. A few moments
after, he slipped, and came near falling into the fiery
pit. In five minutes, an animal or a man would have been
baked to a cinder. Pursuing our way by the four craters,
our path widened, and half an hour more brought us to
the top of the mountain. Our purpose was accomplished;
we stood on the summit of Mount Hekla, and a toilsome
journey it had been for us. I threw myself on the ground,
and took a look at the scene before me. The top of the
mountain was not a peak, but broad and nearly flat, with
here and there a little irregularity of surface. It was about
a quarter of a mile across in one direction—from west to
east—and some fifty rods the other way. In several places
were deep snow-banks, but as yet we saw no crater on the
summit.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now two o’clock, it having taken us about eight
hours to make the ascent. Though we saw no crater, we
had very direct evidence that we were in close proximity
to volcanic fires. Little eminences of lava stood up around
us, from which smoke issued; and the ground under our feet
felt warm. On removing the earth to the depth of two or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>three inches, it felt hot; and on digging down anywhere to
the depth of six inches, smoke would burst out. Six inches
deeper, and no doubt a man might light a segar. I went
close to a bank of snow—to have something to cool my
punch—spread out my tartan plaid on a warm piece of lava,
opened my knapsack, sat down and dined. That was the
loftiest dinner I had ever partaken. I had nearly a bottle
of claret left, and a small drop of something stronger. The
guides had a bottle of milk, the snow did the cooling, and
I made a capital lot of milk punch. I drank several toasts;
gave “the good health of all creation,” toasted “the girl I
left behind me,” and “a health to all good fellows.” Yes,
and I thought, too, of my friends far, far away; and the
distance I had traveled, and must travel again before I
could see them. In that half hour—in that dinner on Hekla’s
smoking summit, I seemed to enjoy a sociality in the
thought of friends and home, that I would not suppose a
communion with one’s thoughts in solitude would bring.
<em>Nero</em> lay at my feet, the guides were conversing at a little
distance, the lava around me was warm; and after a little
time the weather cleared up, and left a blue sky and clear
atmosphere, with a full opportunity to survey the wondrous
panorama of nature that lay spread out below and
around us.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little way to the east was a slight elevation. To
this I directed my steps. Here I stood on the highest
summit of Mount Hekla. A more magnificent prospect
was never seen. Iceland was spread below and around me
like a map. We were more than six thousand feet above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the level of the sea, and higher than the tops of nearly
every mountain in Iceland. To the west and northwest
were vast green tracts of meadow land, checkered with
hills and surrounded by mountains. White, shining rivers
intersected the valleys and plains like long silver ribbons.
Far in the north, and to the northeast, were the snowy
mountains, not in peaks, but stretching away in immense
plains of brilliant white, and glistening in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a valley, some twenty miles to the northwest, was a
beautiful cluster of lakes, the water often of a deep, green
color as they reflected the meadows on their banks. Now
and then in the landscape would appear the Iceland “forests,”
like patches of shrubbery of a dark green hue. Some
hills and old lava districts were covered with heath, now in
full bloom, and clothing the land in a robe of purple. The
surface of Hekla itself, and the ground on every side, some
distance from the base, was one black mass of lava. To the
northwest, and near at hand, rising abruptly from the plain
to the height of 2,500 feet, was <em>Bjolfell</em>, a bold and singular-looking
mountain. A dark cloud lay in the southeast
intercepting the view, but on every other side the sky was
clear and the prospect uninterrupted. To the south, far out
to sea—distant about forty miles—were the Westmann
Islands, rising abruptly out of the water to the height of
more than 2,000 feet, and showing their basaltic cliffs in a
clearly-defined outline. Cities, villages, and human habitations
filled no part of the landscape. The magical purity
of the atmosphere, and the singular character of this volcanic
country, make a view from the top of Mount Hekla
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>one of the most extensive and varied of any on the earth’s
surface.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The view from this mountain must extend more
than 200 miles, showing a visible horizon of at least 1,500
miles in circuit. Most fortunately the day was beautifully
clear; and, after the first half hour on the summit—except a
bank of clouds in the east—the whole country was visible.
To the northeast, seemingly quite below us, in the valley of
the river Tungná, was a landscape of tiny streams, little
lakes, green meadows, and heath-clad hills. One small
lake—the Grænavatn (<em>green lake</em>)—was shaped like the
moon when nearly full, and looked scarcely larger than a
saucer. The mountains to the south, the lofty Tindfjalla
and Eyjafjalla Jokulls, rose up in separate knobs or peaks,
the latter justifying its name of “mountain of islands.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I thought I never should tire of contemplating the
varied scene around me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>“Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Oh! there is sweetness in the mountain air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And life that bloated ease can never hope to share.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Time sped too quickly. The day was fast wearing
away, and much yet remained to be seen on the mountain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>top. As yet, I had observed no crater on the summit; but
going to the top of a little elevation, about one hundred yards
from my dining table, it yawned before me. This was the
principal crater of the mountain, and larger than all the four
that we had seen on our way up. It was of very irregular
form, nearly a quarter of a mile in extent one way—a long
chasm some two or three hundred feet deep—and not over one
hundred yards wide. Some parts of the sides were perpendicular,
and smoke was coming out of fissures and crevices
in many places. There were several deep snow-banks in it;
and though the entrance to a region of perpetual “fire and
brimstone,” yet there has been no eruption from this crater
for ages. We rolled some stones down the steep side of
the crater, that crashed and thundered to the bottom, and
were lost in a vast cloud of smoke. The guides now did
nothing without urging; but I was determined, if possible,
to go down into the crater. We went to the east end of it,
where the descent was most gradual, and on a steep bank
of snow, by a process well known to boys as “sliding down
hill,” we soon found ourselves at the bottom. Rather a
risky place, inside of Hekla’s burning crater; but if the lava
and smoke proved too warm friends, we could cool off by
jumping into a snow-bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>We went through every part of this wonderful pit, now
holding our hands in a stream of warm smoke, and again
clambering over rocks, and standing under arches of snow.
The ground under our feet was principally moist earth;
the sides of the crater, rock-lava, and in many places loose
slags and scoriæ. One most remarkable basaltic rock lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>near the center of the crater. It was spherical, nearly as
round as a cannon-ball, and about twenty or twenty-five
feet in diameter. It lay, apparently, entirely on the surface
of the ground, and though of compact and solid structure,
there were small cracks all over it, from the twentieth
of an inch to a quarter of an inch across. Out of these cracks,
on every side of the rock, smoke and hot steam constantly
issued. The ground all round it was moist earth and volcanic
sand, and showed few signs of heat. Not ten feet from
this rock was an abrupt bank of snow, at least twenty feet deep.
In one place under it was a crevice in the lava, where the heat
came out; and it had melted away the snow, forming a
beautiful arch some ten feet high. We walked under it,
and found streams of clear water running from the snow.
At these pure fountains we filled some of our empty bottles.
For the benefit of any future travelers here, I will
mention, that had it not been for my own curiosity and perseverance,
I never should have gone into this crater, or even
have seen it at all. My mountain guide, the farmer of
Næfrholt, seemed to think his duty performed after we
were once on top of the mountain. I hunted up the crater,
quite out of sight from where we arrived on the broad summit
of the mountain, went to the brink, and then insisted
on descending into it. After getting down to the bottom
of the crater, a way selected entirely by myself, he very
coolly informed me that he had a short time before gone
down into it with some Danish gentlemen. After I had
satisfied my curiosity in varied explorations, the guide proposed
a place for our exit on the west, but where, I am sure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>had we attempted an ascent, we should have broken our
necks. As we could not well slide up the hill where we
had slidden down, I proposed an egress just to the north of
our enormous smoking boulder; and it was so terribly steep
that I thought we should inevitably tumble back into the
crater after we were nearly to the top. “<em>Festus</em>,” while
traveling with Lucifer, says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let us ascend, but not through the charred throat</div>
      <div class='line'>Of an extinct volcano.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not so with us: we did come straight out of such a
“charred throat.” We emerged from our warm pit, directly
on the north edge of the mountain, where it fell off a
vast distance in one perpendicular crag. There’s a kind of
fearful pleasure in gazing from a mountain’s craggy summit.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“And there’s a courage which grows out of fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare</div>

      <div class='line'>Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there</div>

      <div class='line'>The gulf of rock yawns,—you can’t gaze a minute,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without an awful wish to plunge within it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The little green lake lay in its nest like a drop of water,
some ten miles away, and the majestic Bjolfell reared its
black form in solemn state nearly half as high as Hekla
itself. We walked clear round the crater, and came to a
deep, broad crack in the lava, that we had to leap across,
and then returned to the place of our ascent, crossing a
broad field of snow.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>This snow was many years old, and from five to thirty
or forty feet deep; and in several places heat came from the
mountain, and melted it out in a great hole—the shape of
an inverted potash-kettle. I thrust my pike into the snow;
and on withdrawing it, it showed that deep blue tint which
I had supposed was only seen in new snow. Having gathered
samples of all the lavas that I had seen, and loaded
the guides with them, we prepared to descend. Our last
six hours of the upward journey, in going back, was performed
in two hours. Perhaps the loads of lava that the
guides carried, increased their speed, urging them along in
their down-hill course. The narrow pathway between the
craters and the north brink of the mountain, we found far
less dangerous on returning, as the weather was clear and
the wind had gone down. When we came to the steep,
sandy side of the mountain, it would be safe to believe that
we went down pretty middling fast. Perhaps we didn’t
run, exactly, but it was a specimen of rather tall walking.
About half way down, I drank the last drop of——, the
contents of my pocket-flask. “Farewell, thou lingering
sweetness!” Our horses—condemned to fast or eat lava—had
gone round a few circles, circumnavigating one another
by chasing their tails; but they had not journeyed far.
Leading them from the table-land down the steep acclivity,
we mounted: their hunger gave them speed; and
after a sharp gallop, we arrived at the farm-house about
ten o’clock, a little before sunset, having escaped the dangers,
and enjoyed the novelty of the loftiest journeying I
had spent in all my travels.</p>

<p class='c013'>V<span class='fsvs'>OLCANIC</span> eruptions in Iceland have presented some
remarkable features. There are volcanoes that are much
higher than any in this country; but, in the amount of lava
thrown out at one time, no eruption on record ever equaled
that of Skaptar Jokull in 1783. A notice of this may not
be considered out of place. In May, about a month before
this eruption, a volcano rose up from the bottom of the sea,
over seventy miles from land, to the southwest of Cape
Reykianes, and more than a hundred and fifty miles from
Skaptar Jokull. This was one of the most remarkable submarine
eruptions ever recorded. It formed a large island,
and ejected vast quantities of pumice, a light, volcanic substance
that floated on the surface of the water. It covered
the sea for more than a hundred and fifty miles, and in
such immense quantities that ships were detained in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>progress while sailing along the coast. The sea-birds
paused and screamed in their wheeling flight, and the more
adventurous took a ride on a new volcanic raft. His
Danish Majesty, on hearing of a creation of new territory
near his ancient possession of Iceland, sent a ship with orders
for its immediate annexation. The commander took
formal possession of it in the name of the king. But the end
was not yet. The flag of Denmark had not waved above
it for a twelve-month, before it sunk back into the ocean
and disappeared forever. Soon after this eruption in the
sea—from the first to the eighth of June—violent earthquakes
were experienced in the vicinity of Skaptar Jokull,
and clouds of smoke obscured the sun for some days. It
was often so dark in the middle of the day, that a sheet of
white paper could not be seen when held up before the
eyes. An immense shower of ashes, sand, and sulphur
filled the air, and completely covered the land. It poisoned
the vegetation, destroying every green thing where it fell.
Fortunately the wind carried it to the south, and it soon
reached the ocean. Incredible as it may seem, this shower
of ashes and sulphur was borne over the Northern Sea to
the Faroe Isles, Shetland and Orkney, entirely over Great
Britain, across to Holland, and far on to the continent of
Europe, nearly two thousand miles from the place where it
started. Around the mountain, for many miles, darting
flames and lightning filled the air, and the sulphur flashed and
burned far up into the heavens. The next effect produced, was
the heat of the volcano melting the ice that had shrouded
it for centuries; and this caused such a deluge, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>rivers, particularly the Skaptá, overflowed their banks, and
submerged, washed up, and even carried away farms. On the
10th of June, ten days after the first symptoms of an eruption
appeared, the torrent of lava burst forth, and poured
down the side of the mountain. This followed so quickly
after the flood of water, that in less than twenty-four hours
the river was entirely dried up, and people walked across
its bed, where, for years, it had only been passable in boats.
While the fire was contending with the water, a terrible
and deafening, roaring sound was heard, and immense quantities
of steam filled the air. The fiery torrent poured
down the bed of the river, often from 400 to 600 feet
deep, and over two hundred in breadth. Lightning
flashed through the heavens, thunder and concussions of
the earth were constantly heard and felt, and the volcano
kept up a continued and terrible roaring. In its course
down the bed of the river, the lava came to an immense
chasm or pit, into which for many hours it poured with a
deafening noise. The stream of lava flowed first south,
then east, destroying farms, houses, and churches, and
burning up the thickets of wood near Kirkubær. Often
great chasms in the earth would get filled with the melted
lava, and then, as it cooled on top, the heat below would
cause it to explode, and blow large masses of it high in the
air. For three months the lava continued to flow, but it was
not until the next February that the mountain ceased throwing
out ashes, sand, flames, and hot stones. The effects of
this eruption were more terrible than any thing of the
kind that ever happened in Iceland. The showers of ashes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>sand, and sulphur, completely destroyed every green thing
for a long distance. Another most singular effect of this
eruption, extended to the ocean. The fish that had always
frequented the coast, were entirely driven away, and never
returned. A terrible famine ensued. Within two years,
over 190,000 sheep, 28,000 horses, and 11,000 cattle, died
of starvation. About 10,000 inhabitants—one-fifth of the
entire population of the island—perished from want and
exposure. The amount of lava ejected from this volcano
was probably greater than that of any eruption of the same
duration, ever recorded. It covered a tract of country 500
square miles in extent; and had it lain of equal thickness
over the entire surface, would have been over 300 feet deep.
The lava would have filled the channels of fifty rivers as
large as the Hudson from Albany to New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is said that the personal appearance of a certain
quadruped does not give an unfailing indication of the
distance he can jump. This can scarcely be true of
Skaptar Jokull. If size is an indication of power, the
vast magnitude of this mountain would seem to show that
its eruptions would be terrible. It is over one hundred
miles in diameter at the base, and more than three hundred
and thirty in circumference. The most of it is wrapped
in a pall of eternal snow, and centuries sometimes elapse
without an eruption. Inaccessible, except in some places
around the edges, it appears from different points of view
like several distinct mountains; and in different parts it
goes by different names. On the west, it is known as
Skaptar Jokull; and on this side the great eruption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>occurred. On the south, it is called Oræfa Jokull; and at
this point it is the highest mountain in Iceland, being over
seven thousand feet above the level of the sea. Its vast
central surface, and all throughout its northern boundary,
is known as Vatna Jokull or Klofa Jokull, and is supposed
to contain in its hollows large pools of standing water.
This particular account I had given me in a conversation
with Herre Biarni Gunnlaugson, the indefatigable Icelandic
geographer, who traveled over every part of Iceland
for a period of twelve years. During this time, he saw the
entire country, and gathered the information and executed
the drawings for his most elaborate and valuable map of
the island. I can lay claim to some personal acquaintance
with Skaptar Jokull. Standing on the summit of Hekla, I
could look directly over nearly the entire surface of the
mountain. It does not rise from all sides to one peak in the
center, like Ætna, Stromboli, Hekla, and Vesuvius; but to
the eye it presents the appearance of one vast, glittering plain
of snow. The few travelers who have ascended the jokulls
of Iceland, have described them as presenting immense
cracks in the snow and ice; making their ascent more
dangerous, in proportion to their height, than probably any
other mountains in the world. The enormous bulk of
Skaptar Jokull may be imagined from one comparison.
Were it as steep and high in proportion to its breadth
of base, as the Peak of Teneriffe, its perpendicular height
would be more than ten miles above the level of the sea.
Next to this mountain and Hekla, the most noted in
Iceland are the Eyjafjalla and Tindfjalla Jokulls, in the
south, and Snæfell Jokull in the west.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>As an instance of the effects of volcanic eruptions, and
also of the inaccuracy of geographers respecting Iceland,
one fact may be mentioned. On nearly every English
or American map where Iceland is represented, there will
be noticed a large lake called the “Fiske Vatn,” or <em>Fish
Lake</em>. There is not such a lake in existence, nor has not
been for many years. There <em>was</em> such a lake, long ago—I
have not the date, but think it was nearly a hundred
years since; and a volcano rose up from the bottom, filled
its entire bed, and literally drank it up at a draught!
Now there is no vestige of a lake in the vicinity; but there
is a mountain, and I saw it. It lies between Hekla and
Skaptar Jokull, and goes by the name of F<span class='fsvs'>ISKIVATNAVEGR</span>,
or “Fish-lake-mountain.” Nature works by general laws,
but this particular sample of its work seems to us rather
singular. Now, this is a geographical and historical fact,
and poetry can be quoted to prove things that are quite as
strange. <em>Festus</em>, in describing his tour in “giant-land,”
related some of the customs of the inhabitants, and told
how they lived.</p>

The poetry is consistent, for it agrees, in all essential

<p class='c013'>Mount Hekla has a greater celebrity than any other
mountain in Iceland, owing to the frequency of its
eruptions. All of these, for eight hundred and fifty years,
are said to be recorded, and amount to twenty-four in
number. They have averaged about three in a century;
and, though occurring at irregular intervals, at no time
has more than seventy-seven years elapsed from one eruption
to another. The following are the periods of</p>

<p class='c024'>According to the Icelandic records, the surface of the
land in the vicinity of Mount Hekla has been entirely
changed by the eruptions. Formerly, there were beautiful
farms on every side, and the country was thickly settled
close up to the base of the mountain. The successive
eruptions or inundations of lava have covered the land
for many miles around, with a charred and blackened
mass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Icelanders are much more devoted to history and
poetry than to exact science; and on this account the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>various eruptions of their volcanoes, and other remarkable
natural phenomena, have received much less attention,
and been recorded with far less accuracy and minuteness,
than historical events. Owing to this, we have not as many
records of their volcanoes, spouting springs, and submarine
eruptions, as would be desirable. Had we a more
extended series of facts, much that now seems irregular
and mysterious, could be reduced to system.</p>

<p class='c013'>A<span class='fsvs'>FTER</span> our sojourn of two days in explorations of Mount
Hekla, we took leave of the farmer of Næfrholt and his
family, and traveled towards the southwest coast, the Reykir
Springs, and the Sulphur Mountains. There are some
pleasing and original customs among the Icelanders; and
with these are their ways of saluting, at meeting and parting.
Young and old, male and female, have the same
affectionate greeting and parting compliments. They first
shake hands, then embrace with arms about each other’s
necks, and then bring their lips in close contact. I have
sometimes fancied, when they took their faces apart, that I
could hear a slight <em>clicking</em> sound; but this might have
been imagination. When I have been kindly entertained
at a house, and especially if there have been one or two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>pretty girls in the family, I have at parting adopted the same
kind of salute. Some of these compliments came off at the
base of Mount Hekla on the morning of July 30th. This
day I had a charming ride. Our road for some distance
lay through a wood, and I have before spoken of the stately
grandeur of an Iceland forest. In addition to the usual
birch and willow trees, some of which were a little higher
than our horses’ backs, there were many bearing a small
berry—the “blue berry” they called it; and this is the
only thing of the fruit kind in all Iceland. They are eaten
by the natives, usually with milk or cream, and wherever
they are found are highly prized. I have tasted them, but
they seem almost destitute of flavor. It takes a hot sun to
give flavor to fruit, and old Sol does not give much of his
caloric to this country. What would these northern people
think of a luscious peach, just as it is picked from a
tree in New Jersey? One species of rose is found in Iceland—the
<em>Rosa Hibernica</em>; and I suppose they (the roses)
hardly know the difference between Iceland and Ireland.
I have frequently observed these rose bushes here, but I
have never yet seen them in flower. A rose in Iceland
would be a sight. You might as well expect to see</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>“Roses in December, ice in June.”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Here, too, we found that most beautiful of all the shrubs
and flowers of Iceland, the fragrant heath. It is very plentiful,
and of the same species so common in the Highlands
of Scotland. Here it is of small size, seldom more than a
foot in height. It is one of the first vegetables found growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>on the lava beds. It seems to grow on a medium soil
between the naked barren lava and the fertile meadows.
Nearly one half of Iceland is covered with heath, and some
day it may be fertile enough to produce grass. I have
been told more than once that this beautiful shrub will not
grow in North America, but I cannot believe it. In
Europe and the northern isles, and Africa and Madeira,
there are over a hundred different varieties of heath. Why
will not some horticulturists rear a good variety, and try
them from various climes, Madeira, Scotland, and Iceland,
and get some of them naturalized with us in America, that
they might cover our barren hills and waysides, and adorn
our gardens and fields? The heath and the ivy—two plants
almost unknown in America—are more beautiful and do
more in Great Britain to cover up and adorn barren hills
and old walls and ruins than all other vegetation, and yet
they are rarely seen with us. I have been told, however,
that the late lamented Mr. Downing has planted and naturalized
the beautiful evergreen ivy, obtaining it from England.
Let gardeners and farmers blush or boast, neither
nature nor cultivation has adorned our hills with one nor ten
plants that look half so beautiful as the blooming heather
that covers the hills of far-off northern Iceland. The same
species that grows here, I have seen in the Orkney and
Shetland Islands, the Hebrides, the Highlands and Lowlands
of Scotland, England, Ireland, France, Germany, Holstein,
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. It also grows in
Africa, as far south as the Cape of Good Hope, the Cape
heaths forming the most beautiful varieties of floral contributions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>that are seen at the splendid Chiswick flower-shows
in London. Wilkes, in his Exploring Expedition, describes
and pictures the forests of heath in Madeira, the trees
nearly or quite a foot in diameter, and forty or fifty feet in
height. I have an idea of offering a prize for the most
beautiful variety of heath that will flourish in the open air
in our Northern States, and then I think I will import some
Iceland heath, and carry off the reward myself! Perhaps
some of our horticultural societies will take the hint, go to
work, and get it all done before I get back to America.
Leaving Næfrholt, we took our back track as far as Skarth,
where I had stayed all night, and slept in the church a
few days before. The farmer seemed glad to see me, gave
me “a grip of his flipper,” and a fine bowl of milk. I returned
the grip, gave him a piece of silver, mounted my
horse, and off we galloped to the southwest. If the world
was not “all before us where to choose,” all Iceland was,
and on we journeyed. Some hours’ travel brought us to
the banks of the Thiorsá, and we prepared to face its turbulent
and mighty current. Any one who supposes that that
little white spot in the Arctic sea, called Iceland, cannot
produce a river worthy of the name, had better try to swim
across this one. I should far rather breast the Hellespont,
and follow Leander. Larger than the Hudson at Newburgh,
swift as an arrow, white with clay from the mountains,
and cold as ice,—really it is the most formidable stream
in appearance that I have ever seen. But we had ferried it
once, and could again; and a frail skiff put off from the
opposite shore to take us across. The only ferryman was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>small boy, and so I manned one oar myself. The guide sat
in the stern of the boat, and led the horses as they swam
after us. The boy could not row evenly with me; the current
bore us furiously down the stream; the boat leaked
badly; and, by the time we were in the middle of the river,
the horses got unmanageable, nearly upset our frail craft,
and finally broke loose altogether, and floated and swam
down the stream, the tips of their noses and their ears just
out of water. We let the horses go, and rowed like good
fellows, and landed on the west side of the river, but a good
long way farther down than the point opposite where we
started. The poor ponies followed the boat as well as
they could, and after a while all came ashore, some in one
place, and some in another. We now traveled directly
down the Thiorsá, towards the south coast, bordering the
Atlantic. We had a fine journey through the valley of this
great river. There was no crossing except at the ferries;
but the fine farming region, and a wish to get a near view
of the Westmann Islands, and, if possible, visit them, induced
me to make a long and circuitous journey on the
southern coast. The weather was clear and fine, and Hekla,
and the Eyjafjalla and Tindfjalla Jokulls stood up in bold
relief against the eastern sky. The Eyjafjalla Jokull, as its
name imports—Mountain of Islands—shows, on its broad,
sloping summit, several knobs that stand up like islands.
Near the top, where it inclines towards the west, I could
see a broad, deep chasm, filled with snow. This pit must be
of immense depth, for while it is nearly filled with snow it
is plainly visible for over thirty miles. On the more even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>summit of the Tindfjalla Jokull, there are several little elevations
like islands or miniature mountains. Hekla looks
black, clear to the summit, except now and then a small
spot of snow. I do not know where those writers get
their information from, regarding this mountain, when they
speak of the “three-coned Hekla.” From different points
of compass, including nearly every position whence Hekla
can be seen, and also from a sojourn on its summit, I must
say that I have never seen three cones, nor even two. From
all sides, the highest point rises in one single cone, like the
profiles of most other volcanoes. On arriving at the top, it
is rather broad and flat, as I have mentioned; but this is not
observed from a distance. It is steeper than Ætna, but not
so steep as Vesuvius. That old Madam Pfeiffer should
speak of Hekla as having three cones, and <em>no crater at all</em>,
is exactly in accordance with the most of her statements
about Iceland. Where she does not knowingly tell direct
falsehoods, the guesses she makes about those regions that
she does not visit—while stating that she does—show her to
be bad at guess-work, and poorly informed about the country.
The valleys of the Hvitá, the Thiorsá, and the Markarfliot,
south, southwest, and west of Hekla, comprise the
largest tract of grass land in all Iceland. A large share of
it is in cultivated farms, and the rest is bog. In drawing
near to the coast, how magnificent the Westmann Islands
appear! Rising up like columns, they stand from one to two
thousand feet above the ocean. Formed of perpendicular,
basaltic rocks, these and other islands of the north of
Europe rank with the most splendid coast-scenery in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>world. The Westmann Islands are most difficult to
approach. The place of landing is so treacherous, that unless
the weather is calm and the sea very still, a landing
cannot be effected. A high cascade on the main land of
Iceland, near the town of Holt, is a sort of weatherometer
that decides whether a boat can put off with a prospect of
gaining the island. This cascade is one long stream of
spray, formed by a small brook falling a height of 800 feet.
In windy weather, the spray is blown entirely away, so that
from the landing no cascade is in sight. If it is still enough
for this cascade to appear constantly two days in succession,
then the sea is usually calm enough to allow boats to
land, and they venture out. In the winter, it sometimes
happens that for weeks no boats can pass between the
islands and the main shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Westmann Islands—Icelandic, <em>Vestmannaeyjar</em>—were
settled by a colony of Irish slaves, in 875, one year
after the first settlement of Iceland. A Norwegian pirate
cruising in the Atlantic, came upon the coast of Ireland,
landed, and captured forty or fifty persons, men, women,
and children, and carried them off as slaves. Before
he got home, they rose on their captors, slew them, and
went ashore at the first land they met. This was on
the largest of the Westmann Islands; that name being
given them by the Icelanders, as these people came from
the west. Christianity came here with these Irish people;
and to this day, crosses, croziers, and other articles of a like
nature are dug up on the island, and were undoubtedly
carried here by the first settlers. The islands are fourteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>in number; but only four of them produce any vegetation
or pasturage, and of these only one is inhabited. This
is very appropriately called Heimaey or Home Island.
This is fifteen miles from the coast, and forty-five from
Hekla. On this island is a harbor, partly encircled by
a high, perpendicular rock. Here they land and embark
in boats. A precipitous path leads to the top of the island,
where the people, with their habitations, a few sheep, and
their little church, remain two thousand feet above the
ocean. The islands are basaltic, like Fingal’s Cave and the
Giant’s Causeway; but, instead of being one or two
hundred feet in height, rise like immense columns, nearly
half a mile above the sea. The inhabitants draw their
entire subsistence from the ocean and the cliffs, catching
codfish and killing sea-birds, myriads of which haunt
the rocks of their sea-girt shores. The sea-fowl furnish
large quantities of feathers. Some of the birds are used for
food, and some for fuel. They split them open, dry them,
and then burn them, feathers and all. From the accounts
given of this novel sort of firewood, the odor rising from it
must be “most tolerable, and not to be endured”! The
birds most used for food are young puffins—the <em>Fratercula
arctica</em>—a rather small sea-bird, with a bill shaped like a
short, thick plow coulter. In England and Scotland, they
are called the coulter-neb puffin. This beak is a most
wonderful one, large to deformity—nearly as bulky as all
the rest of the bird’s head. There are several circular
marks entirely round it, making it look like a small barrel
with the hoops on it. But do not these hardy islanders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>show skill and daring in the pursuit of birds and eggs
for subsistence? Wonder how the Yankees would take
the birds? Shoot them with rifles, I suppose, “knocking
their daylights out,” one at a time. But these islanders
do not take this slow method—not they. In the egg
season they go to the top of the cliffs, and, putting a rope
round a man’s waist, let him down the side of the perpendicular
rock, one, two, or three hundred feet; and on
arriving at the long, narrow, horizontal shelves, he proceeds
to fill a large bag with the brittle treasures deposited
by the birds. Getting his bag full, he and his eggs
are drawn to the top by his companions. If the rope
breaks, or is cut off by the sharp corners of the rocks,
the luckless duck-egging fowler is precipitated to the
bottom, perhaps two thousand feet into the sea, or is
dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Accidents happen
but rarely, and here these hardy men glean a scanty
subsistence. At a later period in the season, they go and
get the young birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the old birds object, they are ready for them, and
serve them sailor fashion, knocking them down with a
handspike. The old often fight desperately for their
young, and will not give up till their necks are broken or
their brains knocked out with a club. Where the cliffs are
not accessible from the top, they go round the bottom
in boats, and show a wonderful agility and daring in
climbing the most terrible precipices. They furnish
nothing for export on these islands, except dried and salted
codfish and feathers. With these they procure their few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>necessaries and luxuries, consisting principally of clothing,
tobacco and snuff, spirits, fish-hooks and lines, and salt.
The habit of living entirely on fish and sea-fowl produces
a disease among them, that carries off all their children
before they are seven years of age. I am told that unless
they are taken to the main shore to be brought up, not one
single one would live through childhood. Some well-informed
Icelanders have told me that the inhabitants
of the Westmann Islands would live as well, and be as free
from disease, as the natives of Iceland, were it not for their
intemperance. Give a people few or no luxuries—bread
and vegetables as food being almost unknown—and expose
them to great fatigue, wet, cold, and danger; and would we
not suppose ardent spirits would be acceptable? The
inhabitants of the far-off St. Kilda, the most western of the
Western Isles of Scotland, are said to lose all their children
that are kept on the island, and from the same causes that
occasion the mortality on the Westmann Islands. These
islands form a separate Syssel or county, and they have a
church, and usually two clergymen. Their church was
rebuilt of stone, at the expense of the Danish government,
in 1774, and is said to be one of the best in Iceland.
It is supported by tithes, still raised here according to the
Norwegian mode. Christianity was brought here with the
first settlers from Ireland, and here it still remains; and I
have sometimes wondered if, during the changes of a
thousand years, any of the brogue of the Tipperary boys,
or the lads of Connaught, could be discerned in their
conversation. Probably it has all been frozen up, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>exchanged for the more meliffluous tones of the followers of
Odin and Thor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Doubly secure as these inhabitants are, by their poverty
and their almost inaccessible cliffs, one would suppose that
they would be secure from any warlike or piratical
depredations. Notwithstanding this, they have twice been
attacked and pillaged by sea-rovers. As early as the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, piratical cruisers—many
of them fitted out in the English and French ports—came
north; and plunder, rapine, and murder desolated all the
western and southern coasts of Iceland. One English
pirate, named John, was noted for his success and daring.
He was called “Gentleman John,” being probably, like the
Greek cruiser,</p>

      <div class='line'>With all true breeding of a gentleman.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This courteous corsair came to the Westmann Islands
in 1614, pillaged the church, and carried off their sacred
relics. He probably knew the inhabitants were descendants
of the Hibernians, and only showed the spirit of an Englishman
towards the Irish. He also plundered their houses,
and no doubt from the contents of their beds managed
to feather his own nest considerably. He returned to
Great Britain, but King James I. caught and punished
him, and with the true honesty of a Scotchman, returned
their church ornaments. In 1627, a vessel of Turkish or
Algerine pirates, after plundering several places on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>eastern and southern coasts of Iceland, landed on the
Westmann Islands. They murdered between forty and
fifty of the inhabitants, plundered the church and set it on
fire, robbed the houses, carried off all the food, clothing,
and valuables, and then burnt their habitations. They
took near four hundred men, women, and children
prisoners, bound them in fetters, took them on board
their vessel, and carried them in captivity to Algiers.
There were two clergymen among them, one of whom,
Jon Thorsteinson, was murdered at the time. He was the
first translator of the Psalms of David into Icelandic verse.
He also translated the Book of Genesis, and some other
parts of the Bible, in a similar manner. He is spoken of in
Icelandic history as the “martyr.” The other clergyman,
Olaf Egilson, with his wife and children, and the rest of the
prisoners, were sold into slavery in Algiers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Egilson got away two years after, and wrote an
account of their sufferings and privations, which was
afterwards published in Danish. It was not until 1636,
nine years after their capture, that the unfortunate Icelanders
were released, and then only by being ransomed by
the king of Denmark. Their treatment and sufferings can
be imagined; only thirty-seven of the whole number
survived, and of these but thirteen persons lived to regain
their native island. Notwithstanding the sufferings, calamities,
and hardships of the people, the Westmann Islands
continue to be inhabited.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the earthquakes and great volcanic eruptions of
1783, the fish in the neighborhood of the Westmann
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Islands, and all along the south coast of Iceland, have
nearly all disappeared, so that the principal dependence of
the inhabitants is on the sea-fowl. Besides the puffin, they
use for food the fulmar—<em>Procellaria glacialis</em>. For their
winter supply, they salt them very slightly, and pack them
down in barrels. I wonder how one of these poor mortals,
accustomed to so little variety, would relish such a dinner
as they serve up at the London Tavern, the Astor, or the
Revere House! Thor and Epicurus! He would probably
surfeit himself, unless it so happened that he could relish
none of their dishes, and refused to eat.</p>

<p class='c013'>But my pony’s head is turned towards the west, and I
am probably as near the Westmann Islands as I ever shall
be. The disappearing spray of the “Driving Cascade”
shows a rough and stormy coast; so good-bye to the contented
islanders, their sea-girt cliffs, and their sea-bird food.</p>

<p class='c013'>M<span class='fsvs'>Y</span> ride along the banks of the Thiorsá, before my
detour to the south coast, near the Westmann Islands, was
a pleasant one. The little green, turf-covered hillocks—not
appearing much like houses, though they were so—gave
an air of solitude to the landscape, that but few civilized
countries possess. The air was vocal with birds, that
constantly flew about us. The mournful note of the plover,
and the wild scream of the curlew, were constantly heard,
as they rested on the signal-cairns by the way-side, or flew
away towards a thicket. These birds, as well as the ptarmigan,
are quite plentiful in Iceland, and all reckoned as
game-birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>A man could travel through Iceland in the summer,
carrying a gun, a few loaves of bread, some tea, coffee, and
sugar, get plenty of milk and cream at the farmers’ houses,
and shoot game enough for his meat, without once leaving
his horse. Some might not consider it a great luxury,
after a hard day’s ride, to sit down to a banquet of roasted
raven, a fricasseed hawk, or a broiled sea-gull; but it would
be quite as good as the buzzard soup that Prince Achille
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Murat used to get in Florida. Some nice ptarmigan, or
plover, with a piece of a loaf, tea or coffee, and butter,
would make a feast that many a traveler would be glad to
have. Then, too, in the interior are large herds of wild reindeer,
where a good marksman could select a nice piece of
venison. Henderson, the missionary, saw a large flock,
that approached quite near him before offering to retreat.
White and blue foxes, seals, and sometimes an importation
of white bears from Greenland, who not unfrequently float
over on fields of ice, might afford a little sport, and perhaps
profit, but would be rather tough eating. I, however,
carried no arms, except the “pickers and stealers” that
Dame Nature furnished me; so I did not speak to the birds
in the loud tones of villainous saltpetre. I have had my
murderous propensities—nurtured when a lad, by shooting
crows and squirrels—the most excited here, in Iceland, by
some old ravens, who seemed to me to act with a very unbecoming
familiarity. These birds were sacred to Odin,
and I believe the Icelanders never molest them. Odin had
two, one for memory, and the other for news. They used
to fly abroad during the day, and return at night, bringing
intelligence from all parts of the world. One would perch
on his right shoulder, and the other on his left, and relate
to him every thing that was going on, at the same time refreshing
his memory in regard to past events. The old
Scandinavians never used to make a voyage, or go a journey,
without them. Floki, a Norwegian pirate, one of the
first settlers of Iceland, took three of them with him when
he started on his voyage, taking them as pilots, to show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>him the way. After getting some distance beyond the
Faroe Isles, he let off one, and he returned to Faroe. Sailing
awhile longer, he sent off another; and, after a wide circuit
in the air, he returned to the ship. Sailing some days
more, he released the third; and he flew away to the north-west.
Following him, he soon reached the coast of Iceland.
There seems to be a pair of these birds living near almost
every house in Iceland. I have never seen a church, with
a house near by, where there was not a pair of ravens.
They seem to be a much larger bird here, than any of the
kind that I ever saw in America. At the little church and
farm-house of Haukadalr, near the Geysers, were two; and
they would often alight on the church, and sometimes on a
gate-post, but a few feet from me. One of them showed a
great aversion to <em>Nero</em>, and would sometimes swoop down,
and nearly hit the dog’s head. Believing him to be
nothing but a heathen, I had a most Christian wish to send
a bullet through him. But my Colt’s pistol was far away,
and his black ravenship could worship Odin, Thor, or any
other deity he pleased.</p>

<p class='c013'>If these birds are not Christians, there is one excuse for
them. They are very long-lived, and, perhaps, having a
distinct recollection that some of the buildings now used as
places of worship, were built and used for worship during
the days of idolatry and heathenism, they have been unconscious
of the introduction of Christianity. The ravens
here have the same costume as in other countries, dressing
in the “inky cloak,” and “customary suits of solemn
black.” Their language, too, always being uttered in slow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and solemn tones, adds to their appearance of gravity and
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>But as for the corbies, the corn-fed pirates! they never
come here. A crow was never seen in Iceland. Here,
there are no grain-fields to plunder, nor trees to build their
nests in. Ill-bred rascals, living on bread-stuffs, were they
to come here and ask for a loaf, they would get a stone.</p>

<p class='c013'>In my journey to-day, I passed near Skalholt, situated
in the forks of the Bruará and the Hvitá rivers. This
place, dignified with the title of the “capital” of Iceland,
in most of the books of geography that I have seen, is
simply a farm, and contains the ruins of one small cathedral
church, where one of the bishops of Iceland used to
officiate. It is now only interesting as a locality connected
with the ecclesiastical history of the country. On the
banks of the mighty Thiorsá, I traveled some distance. I
find it difficult to leave this river. I like its roaring, turbulent
torrent—to look at—wouldn’t like to swim it
though, unless I desired a much colder bath than I have
been accustomed to. I believe it would be difficult to find
a river of the magnitude, or strength of current, of this, in
an island that only contains 40,000 square miles. The
Thiorsá is nearly a hundred and fifty miles long, falls over
3,000 feet in less than sixty miles, and carries far more
water to the ocean than the Hudson does.</p>

<p class='c013'>We left the river near the church of Olafsvell, and bore
away to the west, through meadows and farms, and one
large tract of lava. On our left, for some distance, it was
all lava; and on the right was a range of hills and mountains.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Our prospective stopping-place for the night, was at
the house of the sysselman of the district; and, a part of
the day having been rainy, I did not care how soon we
arrived there. The roads were tolerably good—that is, for
Iceland—and custom had made a seat in the saddle for
eight or ten hours in the day, a comparatively easy exercise.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, ho! the sysselman’s house appears in sight. Some
large flocks of ptarmigan seemed to be tokens of good cheer
and comfortable quarters. Riding up a long lane between
fences, we arrived at the house, a fine framed building, and
the only house I had seen in some time, that appeared fit
for the home of a Christian. Round it were out-buildings,
and a large number of hay-stacks. The afternoon had
cleared off finely; and the shining of the western sun, and
the presence of a good many well-clad people and children—some
piling up the fragrant hay—made one of the most
pleasant and comfortable scenes that can be imagined.</p>

<p class='c013'>We dismounted, and the guide went among the men,
and first spoke to a clerical-looking personage, dressed in
black. He next saw and talked with the sysselman, who
was giving directions about gathering and stacking the
hay. The guide returned to me, and I understood him to
say the man in black was the parish clergyman. Still the
sysselman did not come near me; but he was busy, and his
tardiness was only the prelude to a most hearty welcome;
for he finally came forward, and shook me cordially by the
hand, an operation he repeated several times while walking
towards the house. He was a native Icelander, tall, well-dressed,
and a man of intelligence. He spoke some English,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and was, evidently, a right down, merry, hospitable good
fellow. Opening the front door of his house, he ushered
me into his parlor, a well-furnished room, having chairs,
sofa, a fine carpet, and on the walls several pictures, looking-glass,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here I was in clover, for once. Visions of down-beds,
a plastered and papered room, and capital cheer, crowded
thick and fast upon me. The good cheer was not long
coming, either—for wine, brandy, hot water, sugar, glasses,
silver spoons, et cetera, and sugared cakes, soon covered
the table. He spoke most every language under heaven, I
have no doubt; but to me it seemed a mixture of Danish,
English, Latin, Greek, Icelandic, and French, with some
broad patches straight from Babel, that my learning
couldn’t exactly sort out. The priest too was present; and
mine host characterized him as a finished scholar, and one
who could talk excellent Latin. His lingo, though, was many
removes from the language of Cicero and Horace. The
sysselman poured out some brandy, and mixed a glass of
punch; and so did I; and so did the preacher; and we
sipped it. I had often heard of the Iceland sysselmen, and
their hospitality to travelers; but this was my first experience
of it, and it went clear up to the portrait my imagination
had drawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>We drank and ate; and he took me through his house,
showed me his library, his sleeping rooms, his handsome
wife, and several rosy-cheeked, well-dressed children. He
showed me an octavo volume, the journal of their Althing
or Assembly; and I saw his name among the national legislators,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>where he had figured as a statesman. He took
down from his library a life of Lord Byron, in Danish, with
portraits, and extracts from his works in English and translated,
and, writing my name in it, gave it to me.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, the liquor seemed to improve him. He
gradually grew mellow; was first kind, then cordial, then
sociable, then talkative, then argumentative, then jolly,
then affectionate, then drunk—or at least rather “how
come you so?” We walked out doors, and saw his people
building hay-stacks. It was a beautiful approaching sunset.
I ran and jumped on to a half-finished stack, to see
how it was formed; but I came off again pretty quick, and
found I had a small brick in my hat! No matter, however,
considering the day’s travel was over. The guide,
though, didn’t take the saddles off, and only opened one of
the trunks to get a book I wished to show the sysselman.
It seemed barely possible we were not to stay all night here,
after all. In fact, he hadn’t asked me to stay. He would
not have had to ask me but once. Our friend in the clerical
garb became very merry too. He made signs of departure,
but seemed waiting for me. Was it possible we were
not to stay all night at the sysselman’s? The guide had
all day told me we should. But the fact began to stare
me in the face: so did a very extensive bog meadow,
directly to the west. But the sysselman didn’t ask me to
stay all night. I wished he had. But he didn’t. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>our horses were led to the door, and the saddles adjusted,
and every thing got ready; and we mounted and rode off.
The jolly, clerical-looking chap accompanied us; though
he was no clergyman at all, but a drunken ferry-man, who
lived on a river a long way to the west. He was to be
our guide over the interesting bogs, to some very nice caravansera,
no doubt; but where it could be, I neither knew
nor did I inquire. We left—we did—and I gave my kind
entertainer a very affectionate and cordial good-night. He
is a merry, hospitable, good fellow, I am sure; but I didn’t
repose under his eider-down.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our ride was a cheering one—in a horn! And miles
we traveled, and—and—and—wait till the next chapter,
and we’ll see what.</p>

<p class='c013'>N<span class='fsvs'>O</span>, I did not stay at the sysselman’s; but I had a ride
of a couple of hours, through a bog meadow, and arrived
about sunset at Hraungerthi—<em>Islandsk</em>—“Garden of Lava.”
This, like many other towns that may be seen laid down
on the map of Iceland, contains nothing but a farm and
farm-house, the residence of a clergyman, and his church.
The pastor owns the farm and pastures, and labors in
his own vineyard, as well as in the vineyard of the Lord.
During the week he looks after his flocks and herds;
and on Sunday he gathers his own little flock of immortals
together, and tells them of the green meadows and
still waters that lie in the domain of the Good Shepherd
in that bright realm where winter never comes, and where
earthquakes and volcanoes are heard not. The clergyman
of this district is Herre Sigurthur Thorarensen, and I soon
found I had lost nothing by leaving the sysselman’s to
come under his hospitable roof. He was not a <em>bon vivant</em>
and a “jolly good fellow;” but he was a man of sense and
learning, a Christian and a philosopher. He spoke Latin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>excellently; and his son, Stefan Thorarensen, could converse
fluently in English, as well as in four or five other languages.
I know not when I have enjoyed myself as pleasantly
and profitably as in my visit at this hospitable mansion. I
soon found that I had gained, not lost, by coming here, and
that, as in many other cases, what seems to be a misfortune
or inconvenience turns out for the best.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Thorarensen had a fine library of books in various
languages, and a copy of the large and elegant map of Iceland
that had been lately published. His house had excellent
furniture, and he was everyway as well lodged as his
official neighbor, the sysselman. The church, a few steps
from the house, was a neat wooden building; and in it were
two monumental tablets—rather unusual in Iceland—one
with an inscription in gilt letters to the memory of Mr.
Thorarensen’s late wife. Every-thing in and about this
church was in excellent order and good taste. Around the
church were small, green mounds, where—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not a “head-stone,” a “piece of mouldering lath,” or single
mark or inscription was seen. Nothing but the little grass-grown
mounds erected over the dead in one of their
churchyards. How simple such a mode of burial! Shall
any of these be forgotten at the sound of the last trump?
Would a “storied urn or animated bust” give them a surer
passport to heaven, or make the sleepers sleep more soundly?
Would a lying epitaph cheat the Great Jehovah, or be admissible
testimony at heaven’s bright gate? Sleep on!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“All that breathe shall share thy destiny.” All shall “mix
forever with the elements,” or be a portion of “the clod
that the rude swain turns with his share and treads upon.”
When time comes to an end, and the earth is withered up
like a scroll, fame will say as much for these humble islanders
as for the proud sons of genius in more genial climes—those
whose names adorn marble columns and gilt title-pages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Thorarensen and his son showed me their farm, a
very neat, well conducted one, and gave me a good deal of
information respecting the <em>modus operandi</em> of farming in
Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great bar to improvement here, as in most old
countries, is the objections the people make to change
old customs. On the banks of the Nile and in Syria,
in the days of Moses and Aaron and in Solomon’s time,
they plowed with a crooked stick, and for a team used
a cow yoked to a camel, or a ram harnessed to a donkey.
To the present day, the cow and camel and crooked stick
scratch up the ground in Syria. In Iceland, in the days of
the Vikings, they had no plows, but dug up their fields
with a spade or a piece of iron. The spade is used to this
day, and the plow is still unknown. In the garden here at
Hraungerthi, I saw Swedish turnips, potatoes, cabbages,
lettuce, radishes, parsley, caraway, horse-radish, angelica,
and some other vegetables.</p>

<p class='c013'>One great difficulty with them in their gardening, is the
want of seed. Their seasons are often short, and the
vegetables, though grown sufficiently for the table, frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>will not go to seed; so that they must obtain
fresh supplies every year from Denmark. Aside from the
expense of this, the vessels that come from Denmark to
some of the Iceland ports arrive but once or twice in the
year; and an order for any article from Copenhagen
cannot be executed unless given six months or a year
beforehand—often a longer period than a man will know
his wants. Accustomed as I had been to see plenty of
vegetables, it did not seem like good living to find few
articles of food except beef and mutton, fish, milk, butter,
cheese, curds, tallow, and lard—all animal food—with now
and then a little black bread, or barley porridge. At Mr.
Thorarensen’s, I had set before me a fine piece of roast
lamb, coffee, wheat bread, Danish butter, and good wine.
These articles, however, are not all found in the houses of
the poorer classes of Iceland. They can all have mutton
and beef, and coffee is a common beverage, and Danish
brandy is rather too common. The most of the Icelanders
indulge rather freely in the use of tobacco (snuff) and
brandy. Having few, or, I may say, no amusements, and
families often living so far apart, that for five or six months—the
winter season—their nearest neighbors are not
seen, can it be wondered at that some excitement to the
animal spirits will be sought from stimulants? I never
saw a man intoxicated in Iceland, and am sure drunkenness
is not common; but the poorer classes do often
indulge in too much strong drink. They generally keep
a bottle at the head of their beds; and when I have slept
in the huts of the farming peasants—not the better classes—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>have always found a bottle of brandy under the pillow,
or at the head of the bed; not probably placed there for
their guest, but as its usual resting-place. I have sometimes
gone into a slight <em>nosological</em> investigation of the
contents, but have never pursued the subject farther. Perhaps
I’ll “look into it” at some future time. I once,
while sleeping in a farm-house, waked up, and saw an Icelander,
in another bed in the same room, pull a bottle out
from under his pillow, and give a long pull at the contents,
then lie down again. I profess a complete innocence and
ignorance respecting the peculiar qualities of the Danish
brandy drunk in Iceland. If it is not better than some of
the “good and evil spirits” seen in some parts of the world—Western
United States, for example—then I should
hardly care to cultivate a close acquaintance. I never had
a “pull” at one of these “bottle imps;” but I have drunk
champagne with His Excellency the governor of Iceland,
and had a very excellent glass of port wine with mine host
of Hraungerthi.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said the Icelanders took snuff. They do; and a way
peculiar to themselves they have of taking it. Their snuff-boxes
are much like a Scotch snuff-mull. I have seen
them made of the horn of a goat, a calf, or a yearling, and
sometimes ivory—the tusk of a walrus or a sea-horse—and
elegantly tipped with silver. They take a little stopper out
of the small end, and pouring out two little parcels of it on the
back of the left hand, apply each nostril, one after
the other, and snuff it up. It is very quickly done, and
quite as neatly as the method we are accustomed to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>with us. That is, comparatively speaking; for, in strict
truth, I will scarcely allow the applicability of any interpretation
of the word <em>neat</em> to a practice, one of the most
filthy—chewing always excepted—that ever besmeared and
disgraced human nature. I should have been glad to have
been able to report the Icelanders free from this vice; but
in this they have been contaminated by habits introduced
from older civilized countries, and the truth must be told.
Smoking is not so common, though pipes and segars are
often seen in the sea-port towns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Respecting cultivation on the Iceland farms, the term
is scarcely applicable. The meadow lands are rough by
nature, and they make it still more so by the way they put
manure on it, leaving it in heaps. I am told that the Icelanders
imagine that more grass will grow on any given
number of acres if the surface is uneven, from the fact that
there is more area. They forget that the grass grows perpendicularly,
and that no more blades can stand on an uneven
than on an even surface. Then, too, it is so very
uneven, that the turf is broken in many places, and, of
course, produces less than as if there were a level, unbroken
turf. Better counsels, however, are beginning to prevail;
and many farmers are leveling down their meadows, and
improving their farms; and they find on trial that level
land produces more than that which is covered with
hillocks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here, at Hraungerthi, I saw considerable timber, and
asking how it was conveyed here, was told that it was
brought on the backs of ponies, just as every thing else is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>carried. Not very large timber, some that is four inches
square, and twelve to eighteen feet long, is carried long
distances. One or more pieces are lashed to each side of a
horse, and with one end dragging, they will go from fifteen
to twenty miles in a day. They cannot carry timber that
is quite as ponderous as the staff of Satan, described by
Milton—a Norway pine, or “mast of some tall admiral,”
being but “a wand” to it. I asked about their heavy articles
of furniture, and was told that their sofa, bureau, and
some other articles, were made there.</p>

<p class='c013'>The church of Hraungerthi was the best I had seen
out of Reykjavik, large enough, I should think, to hold
two hundred people. Many of the Iceland churches in the
interior of the country, are not more than twelve feet by
eighteen, inside measurement.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was so well entertained at Hraungerthi, and got so
much information about the country, that I did not leave
till one o’clock the day after my arrival. A fine breakfast
was served at nine, coffee having been sent me in my room
as soon as I was up. I know not when I shall ever return
any of the numerous acts of hospitality and kindness extended
to me by the Icelanders; and I greatly fear the
opportunity never will come, unless Icelanders oftener go
to America than they ever have. In fact, since old Eric
and his friend sailed to the American continent, near a
thousand years ago, I believe it would be difficult to find an
account of a single Icelander that has ever been in Brother
Jonathan’s land. If ever one does go to America, may I
be there to meet him! and if the neck of at least one champagne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>bottle doesn’t get wrung off, then—then—then I’ll
see what.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the Danish government will open the trade of Iceland
to the world—an event not improbable—we might
expect some commerce between that country and this; and
then the inhabitants of V<span class='fsvs'>INLAND</span>, in their own cities, could
greet the followers and descendants of Eric and Heriulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>W<span class='fsvs'>HETHER</span> Americans will ever have the opportunity of
returning any of the hospitality that the Icelanders extended
to one of their countrymen, is uncertain. At any rate,
their guest was made welcome. Mr. Stefan Thorarensen
insisted on presenting me with a fine copy of the poems
of Jonas Hallgrimson, one of the modern poets of Iceland.
Perhaps, some day I’ll translate it into English
verse! The pleasantest meetings must have an end; and,
after the sun had passed the meridian, we had our horses
caught, and bade adieu to Hraungerthi. Two hours’ riding
brought us to the ferry of Laugardælir, on the Hvitá, too
formidable a stream to ford at this place, and far larger than
I found it above Skalholt, where it came so near carrying
me away. Here we found our clerical-looking friend who
helped make the brandy-toddy disappear at the sysselman’s.
He was the ferryman, his house standing near the bank of
the river. Like some other sanctimonious-looking fellows,
he was evidently a pretty hard case—something of a sinner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>No hospitalities in his house; not even a glass of brandy
and water. He was agent for an Iceland newspaper, and
seeing copies of the last number, I offered to purchase one.
I took a copy of the paper, and then held a handful of
money towards him, for him to help himself to the price.
There were all sizes and values of Danish coin down to a
skilling, to select from; and, though the price of a paper
was just about one penny sterling, he took a third of a dollar!
At the ferry, he “tried it on” again, but there it
didn’t fit. He asked me a dollar, double the uniform price,
for rowing me across, but I gave him only the customary
rate. This was the first little variety that I had seen in
Iceland character; but there are few flocks composed of all
white sheep. When we arrived at the bank of the river, we
saw the boat in the center of the stream, apparently coming
towards us, but on the opposite bank were two or three travelers,
vociferating violently to be taken across. We halloo’d
to the boatman furiously, and seeing his clerical-looking
master, he came to us first. A hook was set near the
landing, and honest black-coat drew it up, and found he had
hooked a small trout. A comely, handsome girl came down to
the water-side; and our honest ferry-master told me, a number
of times, that she was his “dottir.” He seemed very
proud of her; and well he might, for she was a strong contrast
to himself. If he ever gets to heaven, it will probably
be on her account. The prettiest girl I have seen since
leaving England, was selling flowers in the market, at Hamburg;
and the next prettiest stood bare-headed and bare-footed,
in an old brown petticoat, on the bank of the Hvitá,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>with a fish in her hand, and her long hair streaming in the
wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>We had the usual variety in crossing the river. Several
of the horses got loose, and then tried to get into the boat,
or overturn it; and some of them went swimming and floating
far down the stream before they landed. The boat was
rowed by the boatman, and the ferry-master in his “suit of
sables.” The master was a regular “lazy;” and I thought
the boatman would, though on the down-stream side, turn
the boat round in a circle. This boatman was the wildest-looking
man I ever saw in my life. He had no hat, coat,
nor vest, and his long hair, hanging down on all sides of
his head, made him look like a wild man. He was a picture,
and would have made a subject fit for a Wilkie. He
was not a man, though, to be afraid of; and, in fact, I should
rather trust him than his master.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our journey, to-day, led through a country mostly level
meadows and bogs, with a constant range of hills and
mountains on our right. The same continued evidences of a
volcanic region presented themselves, that we see more or
less, all over Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was not as much lava, except on the hills, as we
found in some other places; but a constant succession of hot
springs. Since crossing the Thiorsá river, yesterday, we
have passed at least six different localities where the smoke
arises from hot and warm springs. We were now approaching
some springs far more celebrated than any we had seen
lately, and perhaps the third in point of interest of any to
be found in Iceland. These springs are known as the Reykir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>springs, and are visited by most everybody that comes
to Iceland, being but one day’s journey from Reykjavik,
and far easier of access than the Geysers. The Reykir
springs, to be enjoyed, must be seen before visiting the
Geysers, as they are far inferior to their more celebrated
spouting brethren in the north. I was told I should come
to these springs after winding round a range of hills on my
right; but we kept “winding round,” and I thought the
springs never would appear. The weather was rainy, and
the roads bad, and though we had but a short journey to-day,
I was glad when the wreaths of smoke announced the
day’s travel nearly over. I had here a hotel of the usual
dimensions, and the ordinary sacred character—a small
church, and the poorest I had seen in Iceland. “Frouzly”
haired men, and fat, red-cheeked girls, with large pails of
milk, were, as usual, seen about the farm-house. A bed of
down—what all the Icelanders have—and one of those
small and prettily-checked coverlets, the manufacture of the
family, were brought out to the church, and with some dry
clothes, hot water for my tea, and a large bowl of milk,
<em>Nero</em> and I were soon fast by the altar, and enjoying ourselves
as much as any two sinners in the world. Oh! if a
man wants to enjoy his loaf, whether it is white bread or
black, and if he wishes sound sleep, either in a church or on
the ground, let him mount a pony every day, and ride in
storm and calm, through bush and bog, brake and brier,
and over fields of Iceland lava.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Reykir springs are nearly a hundred in number, and
cover some fifty acres—a tract nearly as large as the Geysers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>occupy. These springs also comprise every variety of
hot, warm, spouting, and mud springs. The springs here
that spout, are more regular than the Geysers, but do not
perform on so extensive a scale. They don’t bore with so
big an auger; haven’t the caliber, nor the capital to do business
on. They are very beautiful; but, to be appreciated
fully, should be seen before going to the Geysers. The
spouting ones are intermittent, giving their eruptions at regular
periods. I found, by consulting my watch, that the
largest one commenced an eruption once in three hours and
sixteen minutes. Each eruption continues about half an
hour. This spring, or Geyser, is like a well, about five feet
in diameter. It has been nearly filled up, by persons throwing
large stones into it. When I arrived, it was not in an
eruption, and down among the stones I could see the hot
water, boiling violently. It was on the top of a rise or
knoll of ground, and I could see that the water had made an
aperture, and escaped through the petrified wall of the well,
and appeared on the surface of the ground, a little way
down the knoll, making a fair-sized brook. No water ran
over the top of the well, only when in action.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time of an eruption, it rushed suddenly, without
any warning, up through the stones, separating into a great
many streams. There it continued playing beautifully,
much like an artificial fountain, for nearly half an hour.
The noise could be heard for half a mile, or more. The first
time it played, after my arrival, was near midnight, after I
had got to sleep. Hearing the roar and rush of water, I
was instantly awakened, and ran to the church window, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>looked out. There it was, throwing up its broad, white,
foamy jets, about a quarter of a mile from me. There being
no darkness here, at this season, sights and shows appear to
about as good advantage in the Iceland twilight as in the
noonday sun. I watched it from my window, till it settled
down, and gradually sunk into the earth. I saw it in eruption
twice the next morning, before I left. Its height was
scarcely forty feet, but it would be a grand addition to the
artificial fountains and warm baths in one of our cities.
Wonder if the Icelanders would sell it? Guess not; it is one
of the “lions” of the country; and, if their curiosities were
gone, there would be nothing to attract the foreigners here. If
a stretch of the imagination could make a spring movable
property, one would hardly think of carrying off Mount
Hekla or Skaptar Jokull. This Geyser is near the foot of a
range of hills, the same as the Geysers in the north. The
brook of hot water from this, ran near half a mile before it
emptied into a cold stream that flowed past. One of the
prettiest fountain-springs in the world is near the bank of
this cold brook, at the foot of a very steep ridge, near half a
mile from the larger Geyser. The basin itself was ten or
fifteen feet across, and shaped some like the half of an oyster,
or rather a clam-shell. The side next the hill was far the
deepest, sinking into a kind of well three or four feet in diameter,
where the water came out. The direction of the well
was slanting or diagonal, the opening coming outward from
the hill. The brow of the hill hung partly over the spring,
so that in an eruption the water could not rise perpendicularly,
but was forced out at an angle of thirty or forty degrees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>with the ground. It did not throw the water more
than ten or twelve feet high, and fifteen or twenty feet outwardly.
This spring makes up for its lack of size and
grandeur, in the frequency of its eruptions, and the beauty of
the incrustations and petrifactions in and around it. All the
bottom of the spring is a mass of petrifaction, and nearly as
white as the purest marble. After an eruption, the water
would gradually recede from the basin, and sink down into
the earth, nearly all disappearing, so that the water could
just be seen down the aperture of the spring. Then it
would at once commence rising gradually; and in three or
four minutes it would get to spouting, and continue going
till the basin was full, and run over considerably. After
three or four minutes it would gradually stop, and sink back
again. A whole round of performance, rising up, blowing
off, and sinking down again, occupied about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a hammer that the guide brought me, I broke up
some beautiful incrustations to bring home. The samples
of these petrifactions are not unlike some found in the limestone
caves of Virginia and Kentucky. The mud-springs
here are very curious. Some of them are like large and
sputtering cauldrons of black pudding. Again, some of
them are seen gurgling away down in the earth; and, attracted
by the noise and the steam, I would go and look
down a hole, and see it sputtering and boiling, apparently
pure clay in a semi-liquid state. The clays here are very
beautiful, and a great variety of colors, as I had found them
at the Geysers. In many places near the springs—particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>near the mud-springs—the clay is soft and hot, often
dangerously so. Visitors sometimes get into a soft place,
and sink into it, getting their feet and legs dreadfully
scalded. In these places it is boiling hot. What a terrible
fate for a man to sink down here out of sight! <em>Nero</em> accompanied
me from the house up to the Geyser, and when
he came to the brook of hot water that ran from it, he
stopped, and gave a howl. Poor <em>Nero</em>! he knew it was
hot, and would scald his feet, and it was too wide for him to
jump it. So I took him up in my arms, and carried him
across. He seemed to appreciate the favor perfectly. The
poor dog did not know but he had escaped being drowned
in the rivers, or roasted in Mount Hekla, to come here and
be boiled in the Reykir springs. Good old <em>Nero</em>! many a
long league we’ve traveled together, and you have got so
you scarcely know whether you like your Iceland or your
Yankee master best. I rather think you like the one best
for the time being, who gives you the most boiled bacon,
and fresh milk.</p>

<p class='c013'>H<span class='fsvs'>AVING</span> seen the Reykir springs, I prepared to
leave. I paid the man the usual sum for the privilege of
sleeping in the parish church, and for the grass for our
horses, and milk for ourselves. He was evidently dissatisfied;
returned no thanks, and did not offer his hand as
a token of satisfaction. From his demeanor now, and more
from some circumstances hereafter to be related, I think
him a bad man. He was of a much darker complexion
than the most of the Icelanders, and a morose, churlish-looking
fellow. Perhaps, from the fact that he was the
landlord of the Reykir Springs—a “fashionable watering-place”—he
had grown worldly, and considered a stay on
his premises worth more than it is at most caravanseras.
He saddled his horse, however, and prepared to accompany
us; probably, though, as a favor to the guide, rather than
to me, as he would not like to forfeit his future custom.
The guide rode ahead with the pack-horses, and I went a
little way to the right to see some hot and warm springs—a
part of the great family here, that I had not seen the night
before. There were two, similar to two that I had seen at
the Geysers, large and deep; perhaps twenty feet across,
and entirely full of hot water, so clear that I could see
perfectly plain to the bottom—about thirty or thirty-five feet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>as near as I could judge. These springs did not discharge
a very great quantity of water; but there they were level,
full, and hot enough to boil a dinner, and there they had
been in that state, probably,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Amid the flux of many thousand years,</div>
      <div class='line'>That oft had swept the toiling race of men</div>
      <div class='line'>And all their labored monuments away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A little way off—perhaps twelve rods—was a cold
spring, and between that and the hot ones was one of tepid
water. “Mine host” rode out near me, to call my attention
to this tepid spring. It was more like a well, about ten feet
across at the top of the water, which was below the surface
of the ground some six or eight feet. I got off my horse,
and with some caution went down the steep, sloping side
of the well, and felt of the water. It was about blood heat,
and no steam escaped from it. The water was pitchy black,
and showed no bottom, appearing of unfathomable depth.
The Icelander also went down the bank, and felt of the
water; and while he did so, his feet gave way, and down
he went into the horrible-looking pool. As he sank, he
turned his face towards me with a look of terror and fear
more horrible than I ever saw on a man’s countenance
before. May I never be a witness to another such sight!
His death seemed inevitable. To my utmost astonishment,
he floated. To go in after him was out of the question, and
would only have resulted in drowning us both. He floated
over on his back, his face just out of water, and reached his
hands imploringly towards me. I stretched my whip to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>him; and as he caught the end of the lash, I pulled him
slowly towards the bank, then grasped his hand, and got
him out. The man was drunk! It was brandy that threw
him into the water, and no doubt ’twas brandy that kept
him afloat. Not being very fond of water, I think ’twould
be very difficult to drown an Icelander. Certainly this one
did not show the “alacrity in sinking” that Falstaff did.
He pulled off his coat, and wrung the water out of it; and
then, in his wet clothes, mounted his horse, and we rode on
after the guide, who by this time was a long way ahead,
crossing the green meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the left, towards the river Hvitá and the sea, it
was level; and on the right, ranges of hills and mountains.
In the course of six or eight miles, we arrived at the
little town and church of Hjalli (<em>he-aht-li</em>). It was Sunday,
and the people for many miles around were assembling for
worship. Every one came on horseback. As for traveling
on foot any distance, such a thing is unknown in Iceland.
Here the landlord of the Reykir Springs left us. He
showed the same ungrateful, unthankful spirit that he
did that morning at home, although I had saved his life.
Holding forth my hand, to shake his at parting, with a
wrathful look he drew his back, and said “Nay.” He had
no reason to treat me thus; but according to an old superstition,
common in Orkney and Shetland, and I believe in
Iceland, I ought to beware of him. It is related by
northern journalists—see Scott’s <em>Pirate</em>—that when a ship
is wrecked, or under other circumstances, no one must try
to save the lives of the unfortunates; for if they do, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>person so saved will some day take the life of his benefactor,
or in some way prove his evil genius. I don’t think
this Icelander can stand much of a chance to be mine, for
in all human probability we shall never meet again. He is
evidently not born to be drowned, but he better be cautious
how he imbibes too much brandy before going to the
margin of a deep well. He may not, at another time, have
a Yankee to pull him out if he falls in. Leaving Hjalli, we
crossed a broad tract of country covered with the beautiful
heath, now in full bloom. I stopped and gathered a large
bouquet to carry home. This day it rained the most of the
time; and, though not near night, I was glad when we
arrived at Vogsósar, where the guide said we were to put
up. We rode up to the house—bear in mind, the Iceland
towns often consist of just one tenement—and dismounted.
The resident was a clergyman—Rev. Mr. Jonson. He
came out, and after saluting me, had a long talk, in
Icelandic, with the guide. It seemed as if I had fallen on
evil men and evil times, for I did not like the appearance of
this man at all. Somehow, he had a forbidding look; and I
fancied we should have to travel further, as I did not believe
his heart or house would open for me that night. How
easy it is to be mistaken! He was like all the Iceland
clergy—and like almost every one of the Icelanders—one of
the most hospitable of men. Having got the history of our
former travels—as I presume he did—from the guide, and
finding, no doubt, that I was one whose character would bear
investigation, he “took me in;” not, however, as the landlady
did Dr. Syntax; but he took me into his house, showed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>me a warm fire, had some fresh trout cooked for me, a fine
cup of coffee, and with a change of dry clothes, I was once
more “in clover.” This was near the sea-shore, on a lake
known as Hlitharvatn, a kind of bottle-like arm of the sea,
where the water flowed in, through a neck or strait, at every
flow of the tide. About a mile south of the house, with the
waves of the Atlantic nearly washing it, stood the church.
This bears the name of “Strandar Kirkja,” or, Church on
the Strand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Southeast of this, a mile or two, is a cape known as the
“Nes.” These names of “kirk,” “strand,” and “Nes,”
show the similarity in the languages in the north of Europe.
There is Inverness, on the north coast of Scotland; Cape
Lindesness, on the southwest point of Norway; and Reikianess,
on the southwest point of Iceland. Mr. Jonson had
some good books in his house, and was evidently a gentleman
and a scholar. He talked excellent Latin, in which
dead language we exchanged our live thoughts. He
evidently lived rather comfortably; and, like most of the
Iceland clergy, was both farmer and preacher. He made
some inquiries about America, but seemed extremely contented,
and well satisfied with his own country. He told
me, in order to cross the neck or strait that led to the lake, I
must start the next morning at six o’clock—“<em>hora sexta</em>”—when
it would be low tide. We accordingly made preparations
for an early start. I found it totally useless to offer
him money for my entertainment. Like all the clergy, not
a penny would he take. I offered a piece of silver to one of
his servants, who brought up our horses; but a half-dollar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>had no charms for him; he would not take it. He knew
the value of money, but he knew it was not the custom for
his master or his household to take money from strangers.
Giving him, and his wife and family, our best thanks and a
hearty shake of the hand, while the morning sun was gilding
the broad Atlantic, and lighting up the mountain tops, we
rode away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our ride to-day, going west from Vogsósar, was quite a
contrast to yesterday’s journey. At six o’clock we found
low tide, and the water nearly out of the arm of the sea that
supplies Lake Hlitharvatn with water. A young tern, half
fledged, was on a little island near us, as we passed; and the
old bird showed great signs of alarm. The little fellow had
not been in the world long, but we certainly were not
among his enemies. The mother bird swooped down at the
dog and then at us, and screamed at the whole party, and
kept it up till we were far away from the little one. Skirting
the strand for some distance, the guide pointed out with
great interest several logs of drift wood that had been
washed ashore.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gales from the southwest bring a good deal of drift
wood on shore along here, every stick of which is valuable.
The coast being low, there is a long line of breakers pitching
their white caps on to the strand. Large numbers of sea-fowl
were riding and rocking on the waves,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As free as an anchored boat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It seems to me that the life of a sea-fowl must be a continued
romance. I would like to fly and swim as they do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>if I could. But some of them have floated, and swam, and
fished their lives away; for their skeletons lie about on the
beach. How black the whole line of coast is along here!
How different from the chalky cliffs of old England, or the
clear-white sand on the shores of America! Here it is all
lava and volcanic sand, and quite black. From Vogsósar
we continued our journey west to Krisuvik, a very small
town near the coast, but it has no harbor. Never were the
striking features of a volcanic country shown more palpably
than where we traveled to-day. We rode on the plain, with
the mountains on our right and the sea to the left. Earthquakes,
many of them very violent, happen here every few
years. Then large fragments of rocks and lava are rolled
down from the mountain tops far out into the plain. These
were very numerous and of all sizes, some that would weigh
fifteen or twenty tons having rolled from one to two miles.
Here the old lava, particularly that which had rolled down
from the mountains, had a different appearance from any I
had before seen in Iceland. Much of this looks like the
conglomerate or “plum-pudding stone” found on the coast
of Scotland, in our New England States, in California, and
in various parts of the world. It looks just as if in the volcanic
times, when there was a general melting, that a quantity
of sea-worn pebbles and very hard round stones of various
sizes would not melt, but became incorporated or rolled
up in the dough-like mass, and here they remain like enormous
plum-puddings at Christmas time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the hills and mountains are very abrupt and
precipitous, like those near Reykir, and farther east, near
Hraungerthi.</p>

<p class='c013'>K<span class='fsvs'>RISUVIK</span> is not a very flourishing city. It contains a
church and one farm-house, the latter comprised in several
edifices, as the farmers’ houses here usually are, and all covered
with green grass. Sir George Mackenzie’s book, which
I have with me, gives a picture of this place; and every
building and object now, even to the garden wall, are an
exact facsimile of the Krisuvik of forty-two years ago.
Two and three miles to the north are the sulphur mountains,
and at this distance show plainly the yellow sulphur, the
variegated clays, and the smoke arising from the springs,
“and the <em>mountains</em> dimly burning.” The people at Krisuvik,
looked very poor and wretched, more so than any I
had seen in a long time. They let us have some excellent
milk, for which I paid them, and made them several presents
of trifling articles, with all of which they seemed greatly
pleased.</p>

<p class='c013'>We sat on an old grass-covered wall made of turf and
lava, and dispatched our dinner; and then, mounting our
horses, rode to the north towards the sulphur mountains.
If there is an interesting development of volcanic heat in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>all Iceland, it is in this most remarkable place. The sulphur
mountains are a great curiosity. The name in Icelandic—<em>Brennisteinnamur</em>—looks
a little “brimstony.” In
about two miles, we came to a beautiful lake of green water,—another
“Grænavatn”—like the one near Hekla. Near
this, in order to examine the mountains in all their glory
and fire, and see the sulphur mines, I had to leave my horse
and climb for it. Sir George Mackenzie gives a very interesting,
but rather terrible, account of this mountain-pass
and the dangers he and the companions went through in
exploring it. The guide, with the horses, kept the plain, and
I turned to the left; agreeing after I had explored the
mountains to come down one or two miles ahead and meet
him near some hot springs, the smoke of which we could
see. As the guide with our little cavalcade rode off, Nero
followed me towards the mountains. As the distance widened
between the guide and me, the dog would stop and
cast a wistful look across the plain towards his master. As
all our separations had been temporary, he felt himself safe,
and with a little encouragement followed me. Still he
would now and then give a lingering look towards his master,
and it required more and more urging to get him to
follow. The distance grew wider and wider; and now we
were near a mile and a half apart, when Nero, with one
glance at me, started upon the run. He flew like a deer,
and taking a bee-line across the plain, was very soon with
his good master and the ponies. Some sharp climbing up
the mountain, nearly a thousand feet, brought me to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>sulphur mines—a scene I shall never forget, a literal pool of
fire and brimstone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Had Milton ever visited the sulphur mountains of Iceland,
I could have forgiven him his description of the infernal
regions. Here was a little hollow scooped out of the
side of the mountain; and all over and through it, yellow
sulphur, burning hillocks of stone and clay, and stifling
sulphurous smoke. The surface, too, was semi-liquid;
in fact as near a literal lake of fire and brimstone as this
world probably shows.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here was sulphur, bred in heat, coming up out of “the
bowels of the harmless earth,” like saltpeter, that was so
abhorred by Hotspur’s dandy. The earth itself here was
principally a fine pink or flesh-colored clay; and all over
this I could see holes communicating with the mighty
laboratory of nature below; and as the steam and smoke
came out of these holes, the fine particles of sulphur seemed
to be brought up to the surface. The clayey ground where
the sulphur lay, was in most places soft, and could not be
walked over without the greatest danger of sinking down
through it, perhaps into the fiery depths, in the bowels of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the mountain. Indeed, it possesses a kind of horrible and
fascinating interest. Around the edges, and in certain
places, the soil is hard, and some stones are seen where one
can go in safety. By having a couple of boards, a man
might walk all over the ground. In some places, the
sulphur was a foot thick; and as it gathered, it seemed to
consolidate, and I found I could break up large pieces,
beautifully crystallized. This sulphur appeared about as
pure as the sulphur sold in the shops, but not as dense. It
had not half that strong odor that sulphur and brimstone
have, in a prepared state. These mines showed signs that
they had been worked, as some bits of boards and planks
lay about, and there were some paths to be seen. The sulphur
is taken off the surface, and then the ground is left for
two or three years for it to collect again. Sulphur is so
cheap, and these mines being so far from a seaport—Havnefiord,
some twenty miles north, being the nearest—and
roads and means of transport being so scanty, gathering
it is not very profitable, nor carried on to a great extent.
There are other sulphur mines in the north; some productive
ones near Kravla mountain, on the shores of Lake
Myvatn. How did Shakspeare get his knowledge of sulphur
mines? He was never in a volcanic country. I think
he got it, as he did every thing else, by inspiration. He
knew that sulphur was generated in heat. In Othello, he
says:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>After Othello kills Desdemona, he calls all the vengeance of

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The “beginning, end, and aim” of sulphur seems to
be fire. Poets and imaginative writers ever associate sulphur
with fire. They give it a home equally with the
lightnings of heaven and flames of hell, the roaring of
artillery and the blazing of the volcano. It seems to have
birth in the thunder-cloud; for, after the flash of lightning,
we can smell it, and after the shower is over, it is often seen
floating on the rain-water. To give one more quotation;
King Lear says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>——“Merciful heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Split’st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than the soft myrtle.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To drive a thunderbolt to split the myrtle, the game
would not be worth the powder, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Near the large bed of sulphur, were several mud springs,
one several feet in diameter. Here the boiling hot mud, like
pitch, was spluttering and splashing up into the air in jets.
I gathered several large lumps of sulphur, and then climbed
over a mountain ridge, and came to another similar place.
Here sulphur had been gathered, and was constantly accumulating.
It seems to be brought up by the heat that
exhales from the interior of the earth, as it collects on every
thing there is on the surface. If left for ages, I presume it
would gather in some places hundreds of feet deep. Some
have proposed the plan of laying boards on the ground for it
to collect on. It would then be very clean, and easily
gathered. In collecting it from the clay surface, considerable
earth must often get in it, but there is a way of
cleaning it. In places away from the sulphur, I saw
the variety of beautiful colored clays, such as appeared
so plentiful at the Geysers, and at Reykir. I had a comparatively
easy walk down the mountain, through a sort
of ravine, towards some hot springs and a green plain where
the guide and horses were. Hearing a roaring sound on
my left, I turned aside to learn the cause; and there was a
<em>steam spring</em>, or rather a jet of steam, that rushed out of the
mountain with a loud and constant roaring. The noise and
escape of steam were incessant, the steam coming out in a
slanting direction, at least twenty feet in a direct line. The
noise it made was greater than that of one of our largest
steamship engines “blowing off.” Without a doubt, if this
was in a manufacturing country, a house could be built over
this natural steam fountain, an engine erected, and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>catching the steam in a cylinder, it could be made to
do good service, and all without fuel, fire, or water, and perpetually.
In Sir George Mackenzie’s book was a description
and an illustration of this same jet of steam; and I held the
picture up, and compared it to the present appearance of it,
and apparently it had not altered a particle in forty-two
years. This, with the six hundred years’ record of the
Geysers, and the twenty-four eruptions of Hekla, shows the
perpetual and constant volcanic heat near the surface of the
ground in Iceland. Near to this was the most extraordinary
mud spring I have ever seen. It was the largest and most
active. It was a regular mud geyser. Imagine an
enormous kettle ten feet across, sunk down into the earth,
and filled to within six feet of the top, with hot, boiling,
liquid mud. There it kept boiling and spouting; jets rising
from its pudding-like surface ten and fifteen feet high; and it
kept constantly going. Wouldn’t a fall into this cauldron
of liquid pitch be boiling enough for one live animal!
Perhaps a boiled rabbit in this unpromising kettle of “hell
broth,” would be as good as the Indians’ way of rolling a
fowl in the mud, and then roasting it. The sulphur mountains,
and all that abound near them, are among the
greatest curiosities of Iceland; but Mr. Barrow, the “very
enthusiastic” yachter, did not visit them, because the
morning he thought of going proved a little rainy! He
also consoled himself for not going to visit Mount Hekla,
because “it might have been cloudy” when he got there!
This is your English traveler, all over. Many is the time
that I have seen them forego the pleasure and profit—if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>such travelers could profit at all—of visiting the most
interesting scenes, just because it would make a dinner-hour
a little later or a little earlier than common.</p>

<p class='c013'>A fine brook ran through the green plain, and emptied
into a little lake not far away. It looked delicious enough
to bathe in; and a bath in a warm pool or brook in Iceland
<em>is</em> a luxury, such as I have tasted. In speaking of these sulphur
mines where the sulphur is hot—and it is gathered on
or near Mount Ætna in similar situations—it may be mentioned,
that there are places where sulphur is to be found cold,
and dug up like other minerals. When a boy, I recollect
being laughed at greatly by my oldest brother, for asking if
there were not “brimstone mines.” Go to! He that runs
may read, and he that runs far enough may write. “The
gods throw stones of sulphur on thee.”—<em>Cymbelline.</em>
Go to.</p>

<p class='c013'>O<span class='fsvs'>N</span> and about the sulphur mountains are a great many
curious sights, and none more singular than the various-colored
clays. At the distance of several miles the contrast
between the sulphur beds and the different kinds of clay was
so great, that the hills looked as if they had been experimented
on by a company of painters, so clearly did they
show their coats of many colors. I stopped some time admiring
the great steam-blast and its blubbering neighbor,
the gigantic cauldron of boiling mud. Fury! I wonder
how beef and plum pudding would boil, if wrapped in a tight
bag and immersed in this boiling clay. Very well, no doubt.
Methinks ’twas very wise in the Almighty placing these prominent
and numerous exhibitions of internal heat in a “far off”
and thinly peopled land, where all the folks are incurious, and
not disposed to pry into nature’s sublime secrets farther
than she chooses to show them. Now, if these ebullitions
of old Dame Nature’s cauldron were in America, some
shrewd Yankee or joint-stock company would go to boring
right down to the center, to get at the fountain head; and
after getting a supply of steam, proceed to let it out in
streams, to turn grist-mills, saw logs, cook hotel dinners,
pump water, drain marshes, and do many other “acts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>things that a free and independent” people “may of right
do.” They would dig for gold, and finding it not, be content
with fire. With that fire they would cook, roast and boil,
warm themselves, and make baths. With the steam they
would turn machinery and spin cotton. Whatever compound
of metals, mines, or elements they found, of that they
would make riches, or at any rate attempt it, and some
would succeed. Some, I fear, would come off as the alchemist
in <em>Festus</em> did, when the Devil taught him. Lucifer, in

<p class='c013'>And I wonder where he’ll find himself? Somewhere, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>doubt. But I am not going to moralize on what might be,
or what will be, when philosophers come to Iceland and
bore out artesian wells. Perhaps if they do, they’ll come
to the conclusion that some of the Icelanders have, that the
entrance to a certain warm region is not far from this country.
These good people are very sensible, in leading upright,
moral lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>But a mountain lies before me, and I must ride. We
had sharp climbing for nearly a mile, and relieved the ponies
by getting off and walking up a portion of the way.
On the summit of the mountain pass—perhaps 1,500 feet
above the plain—we had an extensive view. A long range
of mountains extended far to the east and northeast; on the
west were separate peaks; and to the south we could see far
out on the ocean. Smoke and steam from hot springs and
sulphur mines, rose up in various places.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our descent on the north side of the sulphur mountains
was far more gradual, and quite circuitous. Passing from
a plain through a rocky defile, there I saw the foot-prints of
a former traveler, and where he had attempted to immortalize
himself. It was not President Fillmore, of the United
States, but plain Mr. Philmore, of England. He was here
the year before, and my present guide had been his. There,
on the face of a large rock, he had cut with considerable
labor, the letter “P,” the initial of his name. As it happened
to be one of the initial letters of my name, I dismounted,
and finished the business with my knife, by cutting
in the rock my other initial, the letter “M.” The rock
was a soft kind of pumice, and soon a gigantic M. stood at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the right of the P. Now, future travelers who come this
way, will learn with delight that the illustrious “Plinio
Myghellz” one day penetrated the rocky defiles, and clambered
up the snow clad mountains of Iceland! By the
scrupulously conscientious, it may be alleged that I stole
another man’s thunder, or at least the P with which he
put it down. But of what use is half of a man’s initials? It
scarcely means any thing; and, like half a pair of scissors,
cannot cut any thing; or like an old bachelor, without
t’other half, “isn’t good for nothing.” Now, he put down
the P, and I mated it with the M, and there the two, keeping
one another company, will flourish to everlasting glory.
“Plinio Myghellz,” you are famous; and you, Mr. Philmore,
you’re “no whar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We now traveled over the most extraordinary road I’ve
ever seen on the face of the globe. It must have been a
vast labor to make it passable; but passable it was, and that
was all. It was a bed of lava several miles in extent, and
known as the “horrible lava.” Indeed the road was a
horrible one, and I only wonder a road could have been
made at all that would be passable for man or beast.
Imagine a plain overflowed with melted lava to an indefinite
depth, say fifty to a hundred feet. Then on cooling,
this broke up in masses of rock of every imaginable shape
and size; only none of it was small or smooth or regular,—rough
and sharp peaks and edges, twenty feet above the
average surface; and deep, yawning cracks or seams appeared,
fifty or a hundred feet deep, and large enough to
swallow up horse and rider. To make a road, the rocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>were broken down, and crevices were filled up, to that extent
that the sure-footed Iceland ponies got over it with
safety. Sometimes they jumped over the seams, and sometimes
they clambered or crawled over the rugged rocks. For
five or six miles it was all desolation; not one drop of water,
not a single blade of grass, not one living bird, not a house,
not a single scrubby tree, nor, apparently, a single specimen
of animal or vegetable life, save an inferior kind of moss or
lichen that clung to the rocks. We could see, now and
then, a patch of stunted heather. Such is the process and
progress of nature in Iceland. Lava overflows the land,
and for hundreds of years it stands up, cold, black, and naked.
Finally, a slight and thin species of moss—one of the
most inferior lichens—begins to cover the rocks with a
delicate brown or pale green. After a long period—somebody
else must tell how long, for I can not,—by the winds
carrying on the dust, by the flight and rest of birds, by
insects and the growth of mosses, a little soil appears, just
sufficient to support a scattering and scanty growth of
heather. And now this beautiful little shrub lights up and
adorns the desert waste. If you look on Gunnlaugsson’s
large map of Iceland—a map made from surveys and observations
extending over Iceland for twelve years, it will be
seen that the green, or agricultural portion, is not more
than one-third of it; and about one-half of the remainder—another
third of the island—is a pink color, indicating the
growth of the heath; and the balance is snowy mountains,
sandy deserts, and black and barren lava. Such is the surface
of Iceland. After the bare lava tract has been succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>by a growth of heath, another long period is necessary
to get a sufficient accumulation of soil to support a
growth of grass, the most valuable and extensive vegetable
product of the country. I have noticed on a beautiful
meadow, where the turf had been disturbed, that only six
or eight inches below the surface, the rugged lava appeared.
I have mentioned that no country shows more beautiful
meadows, or produces more fragrant hay than Iceland.
It is of short growth, but remarkably sweet, and I am
sure more valuable, taken by weight, than the coarser hay
grown in England and America.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after getting across the plain of “horrible lava,”
we rode over a low mountain; and before us was the town
of Hafnarfiorth. This is a nice village, nestled in a quiet
little nook; and in its harbor were two or three vessels.
To those who have seen the town of Scalloway, in Shetland,
this place bears some resemblance. Back of Scalloway,
the hills rise more abruptly than here. The village,
though apparently near, was several miles away, and
we rode by a good many fine farms, with beautiful, green
meadows, showing a marked contrast to the lava tract that
we had passed. I had been here once before, as mentioned
in a former chapter, and made the acquaintance of a very
agreeable and hospitable Danish gentleman and his wife.
My first visit was with Professor Johnson, and he did
the talking on both sides; mine host, whose name also
was Johnson, conversing only in Danish and Icelandic.
Knocking at the door of the nice little white house,
it was opened at once, and there was a house full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>young Icelandic ladies,—indeed the prettiest lot of Iceland
fair ones that I had seen at one time. Neatly
dressed, and beautiful girls they were; not one plain one
among them. All were at work, knitting, just as we see
the good dames in America, when they “go visiting” in
the country. One had on the little Icelandic black woolen
cap, with silk tassel, the head-dress of the country; and the
others wore nothing on their heads, dressing in the Danish
style, which differs but little from the “fashions” in Paris,
London, and New York. The good little lady of the house
greeted me very cordially; but she was in a terrible fix, for
she could not talk with me. She tried Danish, then Icelandic;
and I <em>attempted</em> the same, stumbled through two
or three sentences, stuck fast, went on again, and finally
broke down altogether, ending in a hearty laugh all round,
at my expense. Never mind; it’s no hard task to be
laughed at by a bevy of pretty girls. Mr. Johnson was
not at home, having gone to Reykjavik. Though the poor
little lady couldn’t find her tongue, at least to any effect;
but I can tell what she did find. She went to her closet
and found a bottle of capital wine, and she put it on the
table at once; and I shall not tell how many glasses of it
went under my jacket before I left.</p>

<p class='c013'>After partaking of the solids and fluids that my fair
hostess set before me, I rose to depart. Wishing them all
a very good day in the best Icelandic I could muster, and
shaking hands all round—the usual affectionate parting
salute I did not dare attempt, being a naturally bashful
man!—I mounted my horse and rode off. It was after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>nine o’clock in the evening, and the sun was bending low
toward the Greenland sea. Hafnarfiorth is the finest
Iceland town I have seen, except the capital; and it has a
fine harbor. It is quite as beautiful in shape, and as
secure for shipping, as Sackett’s Harbor, on Lake Ontario.
The land nearly surrounds the harbor, forming about three
quarters of a circle. Large stacks of codfish were piled up,
and great quantities were scattered about on the gravelly
beach, drying. After once thoroughly dry, they tell me it
does not hurt the fish to rain on them; and they leave them
out of doors with impunity. They put boards and heavy
stones on the piles to keep them from blowing away. In
this primitive community, all goods are safe under the
broad canopy of heaven, as “thieves do not break through,
nor steal.” Visiting seemed to be the order of the day
at Hafnarfiorth. Several horses stood about, with the
curiously shaped side-saddles on them—like an arm-chair—peculiar
to the country. Boys were holding some
of these; and some little girls, having got helped to seats in
the large saddles, were galloping the little ponies round
in fine style. They were bare-headed, with their long hair
streaming in the wind; and they seemed to think riding
was capital fun. In fact, I never saw an Icelander, male
or female, who was too young to sit in the saddle. These
little northern nymphs seem to take to riding as naturally
as the South Sea islanders do to swimming. The village of
Hafnarfiorth has twenty or thirty houses, and perhaps two
hundred inhabitants. There is but one street, and that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>bounded on one side by the water, with the houses and
stores on the other; and it runs in a circle nearly round the
harbor, close to the water’s edge. If any one comes here
and wants to know where my friend Johnson lives, I can
tell him; always provided he does not move, and no
houses are built beyond his. It is the last house—a neat
little white, story-and-a-half one—on the southern side of
the harbor, the side opposite to Reykjavik. In journeying
from here north, we had to climb directly up a very steep
ascent, to get on the lava bed that covers the ground for
many miles. It was six miles to Reykjavik, the road
passing within about a mile of Bessastath, for a great
many years the site of the Iceland college. Had I not by
this time been accustomed to all sorts of traveling—swimming,
tumbling, flying, and ballooning—I should have
called this road a bad one. Indeed, it was abominable;
but I was accustomed to it. There’s nothing like habit.
Long practice may make sleeping on a solid rock go as
well as a bed of down.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rocks were piled on rocks, and deep and broad cracks
and seams were seen at intervals. Across one chasm
through which, deep in the earth, we could hear a stream
of water running, was thrown a natural arch of lava, that
served as a bridge where the road crosses. Winding round
a couple of deep bays that set back from the sea, we put
our ponies through, at the top of their speed; they seemed
to appreciate their approach towards home; and at about
11 o’clock, we jumped from our saddles, and with a loud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>hurrah, dashed into the hotel at Reykjavik, where I met
my old friend, President Johnson,</p>

      <div class='line'>“A drinking of his wine.”</div>

<p class='c013'>He shook my hand so heartily I thought he would unjoint
the elbow: “My dear Yankee friend, how are you; and
how is old mount Hekla, and the big Geyser, and all the
little Geysers; and how are my friends the sulphur mountains?”
“Why, high, hot, and smoking; how should they
be, my literary loon?” “And a fine tour you’ve had, I
hope.” “Well, I have, my boy; clear to the top of old
King Coal. Yes, and a peep into the crater.” “Well,
you’re one of the boys; and I wish I could go across the
Atlantic, and see old Niagara with you.” And here I had
a bed; no more sleeping in churches; a bed on an old-fashioned
camp bedstead—two letter X’s; high diddle diddle,
the fool in the middle, like the circus clown with a
hoop over his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>I<span class='fsvs'>F</span> a man wishes to study ornithology, let him go to
Iceland. The most beautiful birds in the world, those having
the most brilliant, and finest, and warmest plumage,
are to be found in the Arctic regions. Some of the game-birds
of Iceland, I have spoken of. The greatest favorites
and the most valuable of all the feathered tribes here are
the eider ducks. Their down is the lightest and softest of
animal coverings, probably the worst conductor of heat,
and therefore the warmest clothing, that is known. The
eider down has long been one of the most important of the
products of Iceland, and until lately has usually sold at
several dollars a pound. The kings and princes of the
north of Europe do not sleep on the down of the cygnets
of the Ganges, but on and under the down of the eider
duck. The increased products, the varied manufactures,
and the widely extended commerce of the world, have
brought into use other materials more conducive to comfort
and health than the eider down; and the consequence has
been, the price has greatly fallen, so that now the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>peasant can sleep on down, and it can be purchased for less
than fifty cents a pound.</p>

<p class='c013'>The eider duck—<em>Somateria molissima</em>—is a large and
fine-looking bird. The male is over two feet in length, and
weighs six or seven pounds. His back, breast, and neck are
white, inclining to a pale blue; the sides white; the lower
part of the wings, the tail, and the top of the head black.
On the water, he is as graceful as a swan. The female is
much smaller than the male, and differently colored. The
female is pale yellowish brown, mottled with both white
and black. The tips of the wings are white, the tail a
brownish black. But a poor idea is given, however, of the
looks of these birds by an enumeration of their colors.
The down is a sort of brown or mouse color. These singular
birds have both the character of wild and domesticated
fowls. In the winter they are so wild that it is difficult
to come near them, but in the breeding season—the month
of June—they are tamer than barn-door fowls. On the
islands all around Iceland, and many parts of the main
shore, they cover the land with their nests. When left to
themselves the brood of the eider duck does not exceed
four; but remove the eggs daily, and she will continue to
lay for weeks. The drake is a very domestic husband, and
assists in all the little household arrangements previous to
the advent of the little ducklings. They build not far
from the water, making the nest of sea weeds and fine
grass, and lining it with the exquisite, soft down which the
female plucks from her breast. If you approach the nest—which
is always near the water—the drake will give a hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>look at you, then plunge into the sea with great
violence; but the female stands her ground. If in a gentle
humor and used to seeing company, she will let you stroke
her back with your hand, and even take the eggs and down
from under her. Sometimes she will fight and strike with
her sharp beak, and she gives a blow in earnest. On finding
the down gone from the nest, she plucks off more, and
when the supply fails, the drake assists in furnishing it. I
have been told, if their nests are robbed of the down more
than twice, they abandon the place, and will not return
there the following season. Half a pound is the usual
quantity taken from a nest, and this seems a great deal, for
the domestic goose at a single picking rarely yields more
than a quarter of a pound of feathers. A greater quantity
of down is gathered in wet seasons than in dry. What immense
quantities of these birds come around Reykjavik,
and spend the breeding season, particularly on the islands
of Engey and Vithey in the harbor! Around the houses
and frequently all over the roofs, their nests are so thick
that you can scarcely walk without treading on them. The
inhabitants get eggs enough to half supply them with food.
The eggs are the size and about the color of hen’s eggs,
though not quite so white, rather inclining to a yellow.
They are nearly equal in quality to those of barn fowls.
After the young are hatched, their education commences
immediately. They graduate after two lessons. The old
duck takes them on her back, swims out into the ocean,
then suddenly dives, leaving the little mariners afloat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course they swim. It gets their feet wet; but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>don’t mind that, as they never wear any stockings. In the
winter the eider ducks seldom go far from Iceland. They
visit the outer skerries, and go to the Faroes, and some to
Orkney and Shetland. They breed some in these islands
and the Hebrides, and sometimes on the main shore of
Great Britain. Varieties of the eider duck are found in all
the northern regions, Siberia, Kamtchatka, Behring’s Straits,
Labrador, and as far south as New Brunswick. It seems a
wonder, among all the bird fanciers, that some attempt is
not made in England or our Northern States to domesticate
them. Let some Captain Waterton give them a chance;
and even if they fly away after the breeding season, it gives
them the wider liberty, and the owner saves their keeping.
The flesh of these birds is excellent, better than any other
sea-fowl. In Iceland their value is so great, for their eggs
and down, that there is a law against shooting them. For
the first offense a man is fined a dollar, and for the next he
forfeits his gun. They are greatly alarmed at guns, and, if
often fired among, they quit the coast. So, with kind treatment
they give a good return, but treat them unkindly and
they will not return at all. The power of flight of this
bird, considering his weight, is almost incredible. Mudie
puts it down at ninety miles an hour. One variety, the
“western eider”—<em>somateria dispar</em>—is only found a native
of the northern part of the Pacific, on both the Asiatic
coast and in the Russian possessions of North America.
One of these birds, in a wild state, a solitary straggler, in
“good condition,” was found near Yarmouth, on the eastern
coast of England. That was the only specimen of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>species ever seen in the British isles. What a journey was
that! He must have flown from eastern Siberia entirely
across Asia and Europe! Were man endowed with such
powers, either natural or artificial, would he not be a traveler?
I can only speak for one, but I say this boy would
be a rover if he could go like the eider duck! I wonder
if there are any Humboldts among birds. If this one had
not been invited to stay in England to adorn some museum,
he would have had a good budget of adventures to relate
by the time he had completed the circuit of the globe.
And is it unreasonable to suppose that birds sometimes
actually fly round the world?</p>

<p class='c013'>But there’s one beautiful and interesting bird that has
never revealed himself to the ornithologists of Europe,
except on the lonely cliffs of the Meal Sack Island, far from
the main land and the haunts of men. Here they can be
found for about three months in the summer. Not a specimen
of this bird is known to exist in any collection. Some
Danish naturalists have for years offered $200 for a pair,
either dead or alive. The great danger in approaching
this almost inaccessible island, with the strong currents that
run by it, and the wild nature of the bird, have, so far,
defied the efforts of yachtsmen, travelers, hunters, and
fishermen. The Icelander scarcely ever does any thing for
the sport or adventure of the thing; and rarely will a large
reward tempt him to go into any scene possessing much
novelty or danger, unless his own direct duty lies in that
direction. I have seen a water-color drawing of this bird,
at a gentleman’s house at Reykjavik. He evidently belongs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>to the penguin tribe. He is not as large as the penguin,
but about two feet in height, and stands as straight
up as a man. His back is dark colored, nearly black, and
the belly white. It is evidently a marine bird, and one
fond of lonely regions and cold climates, and at this time
possesses much interest, simply because we cannot catch
him. He is entitled to his liberty; at least I shall give
him my vote to allow him to remain in his present free and
independent state. I have his Latin name written down;
and anyone that is good at deciphering bad writing, and
thinks he can read this language of the Cæsars when written
by a Dane, may examine this singular specimen of chirography.
It appears to me, to be as difficult to hunt out
as a sample of the bird itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have now to speak of a far different specimen of the
feathered tribe—the cormorant. He is a vile bird. I say
vile, for he’s a glutton; his flesh is rank and unsavory, and
he’s far from being a neat, tidy bird. The cormorant—<em>Carbo
cormoranus</em>—is common on the shores of Europe
and America, and in the islands of the sea as far north as
the Arctic circle. They are apparently larger than the
goose, but not so heavy. Color black, except the wings
dark brown, and sides of the head and a spot on the thigh
white. Though web-footed, he perches on trees, and sometimes
builds his nest there. The bill of the cormorant is
about five inches in length, the upper mandible much
hooked. With this he takes his prey, the unlucky loiterers
of the finny tribe. He catches them usually across, and,
if large, he often rises in the air, throws up the fish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and as it falls head first he catches him endwise, and the
fish, while struggling with life, finds a grave in the cormorant’s
stomach. He will eat his own weight of fish in one
day; and then, gorged to stupidity, he flies to a lonely cliff,
spreads out his wings to dry, and lays there in a state of
half torpor for several hours, like an anaconda after he has
swallowed an ox. In this state, if his resting-place is
accessible, the bird can be captured readily. At one season
of the year—the breeding time—this bird and the <em>shag</em>,
another species of cormorant, have a crest on the head, of
greenish feathers. These afterwards disappear.</p>

<p class='c013'>A far more elegant and interesting bird, is the gannet or
Solan goose—<em>Sula bassana</em>. On the wing, the gannet is
the most striking-looking bird I have ever seen. They are
three feet in length, and their wings stretch six feet. They
are white, except the outer half of the wing, which is black,
the bill, legs, and feet black, and head yellow. What
crowds of them we saw, both in the air and on the water,
off Cape Skagen, near the southwestern part of Iceland!
During the summer, the Meal-Sack Island swarms with
them. The female lays but one or two eggs, nearly white,
but not much larger than the common duck’s egg, though
the bird is as large as the goose. The gannet is exceedingly
fond of rocky islands a little way from the main shore, like
the Bass rock in the Forth, the Ailsa Craig in the Clyde,
and on the Iceland Meal-Sack. By these and similar
places is either a strong current or a strong run of tide, and
here are plenty of fish. Herrings, and very often cod and
haddock, are their favorite prey. On the wing as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>in the water, the gannet is a powerful bird. With terrible
impetuosity, they descend from a great height, and plunging
into the water, seize and carry off their prey. Like all
fishing birds, the gannet has a keen sight, keener probably
than the eagle, for he can discern his prey in the water,
while at a great height, and when the curl of the surface
so scatters the light that human vision, aided by all the
contrivances of science, cannot penetrate a single inch.
How singular is nature in all her operations! But for a
peculiar structure, this bird, as swift as he has to plunge
into the water, would be killed, or at least stunned and rendered
helpless. The cellular tissue beneath the skin, on the
under part of the bird, is formed into air-cells, and inflated
by a peculiar muscular action; and this gives a surface of
great elasticity, and both breaks the force of the blow, and
prevents the bird going very deep under water. When
the gannet comes up with his prey, he rises by a regular
momentum directly out of the water, and is on the wing
the instant he appears above the surface.</p>

Iceland.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A<span class='fsvs'>MONG</span> the birds of the far North, the snow-bunting—<em>Emberiza
nivalis</em>—is one of the most interesting. Who
has not seen the pretty “snow-bird” during a driving
snow-storm, come round the barn for some hay-seed, or to
the house for a crumb? But where do they go in summer?
Why, they go to Iceland, and a nice time they
have of it. They build their nests in the crags; and the
male perches on some rock in the vicinity and sings all
day long, while the female lays five small round eggs.
The male bird takes his turn in sitting on the nest; and
they feed on the seeds of grass, rushes, and other hardy
northern plants. How extensively this bird migrates, it is
difficult to tell. We naturally suppose that small birds
have less power of flight than large ones; but the Mother
Carey’s chicken is found on the stormy ocean, a thousand
miles from land. In America, the snow-bird probably goes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to the region of Labrador and Hudson’s Bay in summer.
Some may fly across Baffin’s Bay to Greenland, or even
across the Greenland Strait, from there to Iceland, a journey
that would not require a sea-flight of over 300 miles at
any one place. The snow-birds that summer in Iceland
may, and very likely do, fly south, taking the range of the
Faros, Shetland, and Orkney, and so to Scotland, England,
and the Continent. Great numbers of these birds spend
their summer in Lapland, where they get very fat on the
seeds that they gather on the plains, and in the lowlands.
The Laplanders kill many of them for food, and prize them
highly. In their winter plumage they are, like the ptarmigan,
almost entirely white; but in summer they are more of
a brown. In summer, this bird is fond of rocky and mossy
places, where there are no trees and few bushes.</p>

<p class='c013'>A singular characteristic of most migrating birds, is
very conspicuous in the snow-bunting. The male is most
sensitive to heat, and the female to cold. In northern
climes the male of this, as well as some other birds, is often
seen in spring several days before the female. Then in
their autumn migration the female appears in the region of
its winter residence considerably before the male. We
should suppose they would migrate together, when the
male bird would have an opportunity of showing off his
gallantry; which, with another class of bipeds, is considered
mutually agreeable. Many of these modest and unostentatious
birds have I seen, while riding across the dreary
heaths of Iceland, perched on a stone or a mossy ridge, and
singing and chippering away, as much as to say, “Here I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>am, as far north as old Boreas will let me go.” The snow-birds
undoubtedly take pretty long flights at sea, for they
usually appear on the coast of England and Scotland late
in the autumn, along with, and apparently driven by the
northeast winds, having undoubtedly flown across the German
Ocean, from the Norwegian coast. On their arrival,
they appear sadly emaciated and exhausted, and some of
them perish. With the wind that brings them, or soon
after, generally comes a fall of snow. Without resting on
the water, like the Mother Carey’s chicken, the gull, the
pochard, the Solan goose, and other sea-birds, the snow-bunting
must have a weary time of it in his flight across the
stormy sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of gulls, there is almost an endless variety in Iceland;
and, apparently, quite an endless quantity. Some of these
are very large, larger than geese; and, though much “run
to feathers,” and not as much solid flesh as the goose, will
often weigh six or eight pounds. Their wings extend over
six feet. This bird is common, in some of its numerous
families, wherever there is salt water; but there is one species
peculiar to this country, and rarely found south of here—the
Iceland gull—<em>Larus Icelandicus</em>. It is a kind of bluish
ash-color on the back, and the rest of the bird white.
Like all his brethren, he is a great fisherman, and he knows
where he can go and catch his dinner.</p>

<p class='c013'>The skua gull—<em>Lestris Cataractes</em>—is a bird of very
peculiar habits. It is seldom found except in the Arctic or
Antarctic regions. Captain Cook found it while he was
skirting the polar ice. They are a very exclusive sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>bird, living in large colonies, where none but their own species
are allowed to come. They are terrible fighters; and
other gulls, or even the eagle or the raven, or scarcely man
himself, can invade their colony with impunity. Against a
large bird of prey, during the breeding-season, they will
charge <em>en masse</em>; and wo be to their enemy! He will get
pierced with scores of angry beaks. It is hazardous for
man, and instances are mentioned of some who have gone
among them without much protection to their heads, and
actually got their skulls broken by these powerful birds.
These gulls are not fond of fishing; they prefer that others
should fish for them. When the great gull, or any other of
the fishing-tribes, has got a load, and filled his stomach,
neck, and bill, with fish, and is flying slowly and heavily
away to his expectant brood, this arrant freebooter, the skua
gull, dashes at the sober fisherman; and his only chance of
life is to disgorge all he has, and the skua catches it in its
fall, or picks it up from the surface of the water or land.
The Icelanders sometimes, in visiting the haunts of skua,
carry a sharp pike projecting a little above the head, and
the heedless gull comes dashing down at the man, and is
transfixed on the murderous iron.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the birds found in Iceland, and peculiar to high
Arctic and Antarctic regions, is the large snowy owl—<em>strix
nyctea</em>. This is a magnificent bird, two feet in length, and
four feet and a half in the stretch of its wings. One of
these birds adorns the parlor of Mr. Simpzen, an Iceland
merchant at Reykjavik. This bird is literally as white as
snow, though the females and the younger birds have some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>brownish feathers. The snowy owl is a bird of prey, and
night and day are the same to him. The ptarmigan and
the tern, cannot, all of them, find food during the long Iceland
winters; therefore, some of them, in their turn, furnish
dinners for his majesty, the white owl. When the wind
beats, and the snow drives, so that they would sweep the
birds to destruction, out comes this king of the wilds, clad in
his armor of impenetrable down and feathers; and, riding
on the wings of the tempest, keeps holiday amid the wildest
turmoil of nature. All parts of the bird, except the point of
the beak, the nails, and the eye-balls, are covered with
feathers, so that he fears not the cold. This bird remains
the whole year in Iceland, and is very rarely, and that in the
coldest of weather, found as far south as Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c013'>One more feathered resident, and I have done. One of
the hawk-tribe, peculiar to this country, the Jer-Falcon—<em>Falco
Icelandicus</em>—is a most remarkable bird. He is peculiarly
adapted to the wilds of Iceland, and the cold, naked
cliffs of the Northern Isles. Though not often seen, there is
no reason to believe their numbers are as small as might be
supposed. They are no parasites, like the skua gull. Not
they. They catch their prey alive and on the wing; and so
terrible and unerring is their flight, that nothing can escape
them. Except his near relative, the peregrine falcon, there
is probably not a bird in the world that can equal his speed
on the wing. Gray, like his native cliffs, he will sit on
a projecting crag, quiet for hours, until a flock of rock-doves
or some ducks, are seen flying by. He leaps into the
air, vaulting upwards till he has “got the sky” of his prey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to a sufficient height for gaining the necessary impetus; his
wings shiver for a moment, as he works himself into a perfect
command and poise, and to the full extent of his energy.
Then he dashes downwards with such velocity that the impression
of his path remains on the sky, like that of the
shooting meteor or the flashing lightning, and you fancy
there is a torrent of falcons rushing through the air. The
stroke is as unerring as the motion is fleet. If it take effect
in the body, the bird is trussed, and the hunt is over; but if
a wing only is broken, the maimed bird is allowed to
flutter to the earth, and another victim is selected. It sometimes
happens that some inferior bird of prey comes in for
the wounded game; but in order to get it, he must proceed
cautiously and stealthily, for wo betide it if it rises on the
wing, and meets the glance of the falcon. The raven himself,
never scoops out another eye, if he rises to tempt that
one. This bird is found in Norway, and sometimes in the
north of Scotland. In former days they were used in hawking,
and, in consequence of their strength and daring and
their unerring stroke, they were more prized in falconry than
any other; but they were difficult to train; and, consequently,
in the days of falconry they brought very high
prices. The velocity of their flight, as well as that of the
peregrine falcon, is put down at one hundred and fifty miles
an hour. Compare that to a modern “express train!”
How the latter lags behind! The flight of birds on long
journeys is well ascertained, and numerous instances are recorded
of the amazing velocity of falcons. King Henry
IV., of France, had a peregrine falcon that flew to Malta,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>thirteen hundred and fifty miles, and arrived there the same
day that he left Fontainbleau. Mudie says, the peregrine
falcon is <span class='fss'>THE</span> falcon, <em>par excellence</em>, of the falconers, on account
of his rapid, powerful flight, great tractability, and
other good qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <em>falcon</em>, in falconry, always means the female, as
they only are trained. The male is called the <em>tercel</em>. Indeed,
our Saxon ancestors must have had some lofty sport.
Wish I had been there! The jer-falcon, our Iceland bird,
is not by any means confined to his native cliffs. Iceland is
four or five hundred miles from Scotland, but only a morning’s
flight for this fleet traveler! He could take his breakfast
in his native wilds, with the sun high in the heavens, fly
over to Scotland, dine on a ptarmigan or a rock-dove, sleep
through the heat of the day, and return to Iceland long before
sunset. Such is the flight of this powerful, swift-winged
bird of prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>I<span class='fsvs'>N</span> our outward as well as return voyage we passed
near the Faroe Islands. These, like Iceland, are under the
jurisdiction of Denmark, and, though near 300 miles from
their northern neighbor, have many features in common
with it. The scenery is singularly wild and picturesque.
We sailed nearly under some of the tall cliffs, and could
plainly see the pillared columns of basalt, so common
throughout Iceland and nearly all the northern isles. From
conversation with two English gentlemen that I met a short
time since, who had just returned from Faroe, where they
had been “birds’ nesting,”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and from one or two authentic
narratives, I gathered some interesting particulars of their
topography and history. The Faroe Isles are probably less
known to modern travelers than any inhabited land in the
northern sea. Many there are that visit Greenland—some
catching whales and seal; a few to convert the heathen;
some on a scientific tour; and, latterly, many in search of a
distinguished navigator and the hapless screws of two long-missing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>ships—and not unfrequently do civilized men land
on the bleak and frozen shores of Spitzbergen; and any
one can visit Lapland by steam; but one may go round the
world and not meet a christian man that has stepped on
one of the seventeen of the inhabited islands of Faroe. The
whole group consists of twenty-five islands, extending about
sixty-five miles from north to south, and forty-five from east
to west; and containing a little less than a thousand square
miles. They lie between 61° 26″ and 62° 25″ N. Latitude,
and 6° 40″ and 7° 40″ West Longitude from Greenwich.
They are 185 miles northwest of Shetland, and 400 from
Norway. This much for their location and size. The surface
of the different islands varies in appearance considerably,
but they all have remarkably bold, perpendicular
banks. The northeastern one, Fugloe—or Bird-island—is
quite flat on the top; but the banks on every side are high
and perpendicular, so that boats must always be raised and
lowered with ropes. Oesteroe, the largest but one, is the
highest of the entire group, rising 3,000 feet above the level
of the sea. On some parts of its precipitous cliffs are majestic
octagonal pillars of basaltic rock, a hundred feet high
and six feet in diameter. Were these in a land of population
and wealth they would undoubtedly be selected by
builders, and be seen supporting and adorning the porticoes
of temples of Grecian or Roman architecture. One of these
pillars, sixty feet in length, has fallen across a deep chasm,
and forms a natural bridge from one side to the other.
Another enormous mass of rock, twenty-four feet long by
eighteen broad is so exactly balanced across another that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the strength of a finger will vibrate it; and though the
waves have been dashing against it for ages, there it remains,
poised on a pivot, like the famous rocking stone in Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stromoe, south of Oesteroe, is the largest of the Faroe
group, and is 27 miles long by about 7 broad, and contains
140 square miles. On this island is Thorshaven, the capital
and principal seaport. The Danish post-ship between
Denmark and Iceland, lands here twice or three times in a
year. Thorshaven has a church, and about 100 dwellings;
some of them comfortable framed houses. This important
place is well protected by a substantial fort—an excellent
fortification, that lacks but one essential article, cannon!
However, there is little chance that they would ever be
needed did they have them. Were there any thing here
worth the trouble of an invading army or a piratical crew,
at the most favorable landing on the islands, the natives
would stand a good chance to crush their invaders with
their natural means of defense, and keep them off by rolling
stones down upon them. But what freaks old nature plays
here among these tall cliffs! What houses for sea-monsters
does old ocean create! The island of Nalsoe is pierced
from side to side, so that in calm weather a boat can sail
through it, under a natural arch, with near 2,000 feet of
solid rock overhead. At the northern end of Stromoe is the
promontory of Myling, which rises perpendicularly to the
height of 2,500 feet. If the spectator had nerve enough, he
might go to the brink, and toss a pebble clear into the sea
from the lofty summit. One singular rock in this group of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>islands, rises out of the water like a lofty spire, and is called
by the natives the Trollekone-finger, or <em>witch’s finger</em>. The
most western of the islands is Myggeness; and, though
inhabited, is so difficult of access that communication between
that and the rest of the group is not usually more
than three or four times a year. It is surrounded by precipitous
cliffs, from 1,200 to 1,400 feet in height; and the passage
or fiorth between this and the neighboring island is the
most dangerous in the group. Off Myggeness, is Myggenessholm,—a
precipitous rock standing alone in the sea, like a
solitary sentinel attendant on the larger isle. Any one who
has seen the Meal-sack island off the southwest coast of Iceland,
or the Holm of the Noss in the Shetland group, or
Ailsa Craig in the Clyde, will have an idea of the appearance
of this rocky islet. This is the only island in the
Faroe group where the Gannet, or Solan Goose, builds its
nest. The choice of such a location as this, or Ailsa Craig,
or the Meal-sack—all favorite localities of this bird—is not
altogether from the generally inaccessible nature of the
place and its consequent immunity from hostile man—though
this is some consideration. These haunts of the gannet
are always near a good “run” of fish, and this is usually
where there is a strong flow of the tide between two islands
or between an island and the main shore. Graba, a late
traveler in Faroe, speaks of landing on the small island of
Store Dimon. He says the clergyman visits this island but
once a year, and the sides are so steep they have to pull him
up with ropes as they would a bag of meal. When Graba
landed, the natives pushed one of their number up the rocks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>with their long sticks that they use in bird-catching, and
then he drew up the rest. In this way they all passed from
one cliff to another, till they arrived at the top, 250 feet
above the water. The steepness of the rock was fully appreciated
on their return, when a basket of eggs was let down
into the boat by a rope. In passing up and down they
sometimes walked on a narrow shelf of rock; and when this
ceased, the “highway” was continued by having holes cut
in the perpendicular face of the cliff, once in two or three
feet, for the fingers and toes. Along this frightful precipice,
a drunken native passed in safety with a sack of barley on
his back.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the great natural curiosities of the islands, is the
Vogelberg; a terrible chasm, of an elliptical form, almost
entirely surrounded by rocks, at least a thousand feet in
height. The entrance is by a narrow passage at one end;
and here, in this remarkable house, with the sea for a floor
and the sky for a roof, are thousands of birds. Sheltered
from every wind, the boat glides along with perfect safety.
Gulls and guillemots swim by without fear; the seal looks
from his watery cave in fancied security; and the lazy cormorant
stretches out his neck to scan the appearance of the
newly-arrived visitors. Long lines of kittiwakes show their
white breasts and dove-like eyes; from narrow shelves of
the rock, nest succeeds nest, and the downy young appear
in frightful proximity to the edge of the precipice beneath.
The puffins take the highest stations, perhaps because they
are puffed up with ideas of their own importance, being
favorites of man, and often captured for their flesh and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>feathers. In sheltered and dark places, will be found the
rock-dove; and dashing past like a pirate, is seen the skua,
pursuing the gull or the puffin, and striving for a dinner he
has never earned. Graba visited this singular place in a
boat, accompanied by several natives. He describes the
noise made by the innumerable sea-fowl, as almost deafening.
Seeing a rare bird that he was desirous of obtaining
a specimen of, he raised his gun and fired. “What became
of it,” says he, “I know not. The air was darkened by the
birds roused from their repose. Thousands hastened out of
the chasm with a frightful noise, and spread themselves in
troops over the ocean. The puffins came wondering from
their holes, and regarded the universal confusion with
comic gestures; the kittiwakes remained composedly in
their nests; while the cormorants tumbled headlong into the
sea.” That was, undoubtedly, the first gun that was ever
fired there since the creation of the world. In a little time,
the confusion and smoke passed away, and every thing
resumed its wonted appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suderoe, the most southern of the islands, as indicated
by its name, is of very irregular shape, contains about forty-four
square miles, and differs materially from the most
northern of the group. This island produces more and
better grain, is better cultivated, and has some valuable
beds of coal. Several kinds of land birds, the lark, the rail,
and the swallow, are found in Suderoe, and not in the
islands farther north. The natives of Suderoe are said to be
more industrious and ingenious, and to speak a language
differing considerably from the inhabitants of the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>islands. Their principal town, Qualhoe, is the finest and
best-built village in Faroe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The climate of Faroe is much more genial and mild
than would be supposed from its latitude, and far less severe
in winter than many places in a more southern latitude on
the continent of Europe. The curlew and some other birds
winter here, while they are not found on the continent,
at this season, as far north as Hamburg. The ground
is seldom frozen for a month, and snow never falls deep, or
lasts over a week at a time. The summer, neither here or
in Iceland, is hot, though there are some warm days in July
and August. While grain is never grown in Iceland, here
they cultivate barley and oats, at a height of from two to six
hundred feet above the level of the sea. Grass grows at an
elevation of two thousand feet, but a little above that vegetation
ceases, and the land is a desert. Sometimes a violent
wind occurs, that will roll up the grassy turf like a side
of sole leather; and in this way the tops of some hills get
entirely denuded, the turf being carried into the sea. Trees
do not grow here; these islands resembling, in that respect,
Iceland, and the groups of Shetland and Orkney. Thunder
here, as in Iceland, is heard in winter, but seldom in summer.
There are a few lakes in the islands; Leinumvatn, in
Stromoe, being one of the largest. It is in a somber,
melancholy-looking valley, and resembles some of the small
lakes in the Highlands of Scotland. As in all mountainous
and peat districts, there are plenty of springs of fresh water.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spoken language of the Faroese resembles that of
the Icelanders, but the people have not the same literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>taste and love of history. Their written language is the
Danish. Originally settled from Norway by piratical
cruisers, and about the time of the settlement of Iceland,
the history of the islands has much in common with the
more northern land. They paid tribute, or were expected
to, to the reigning chief in Norway; but the latter was very
unfortunate in his collection of it. The deputy or collector
sent out for this purpose seldom returned, and was rarely or
never seen in Norway again. Some, attracted by the independent
bearing of the people, took wives from among the
fair Faroese, and settled permanently; thus paying a very
direct and unmistakable compliment to a brave, independent,
and republican people. Others declared themselves
firm and incorruptible, and determined to execute
their trust. Marriage is a most excellent institution and
all the Norwegian collectors who took brides from among
the Faroe maidens, found it, no doubt, particularly to their
own advantage, and, at the same time, in accordance with
the good wishes and prosperity of the islanders themselves.
Those who would not accept wives on such fair terms, were
never heard of again. Their bones were buried at low
tide! The king of Norway kept sending his deputies to
Faroe, and they and their ships disappeared one after
another, till finally none of his majesty’s subjects would
undertake the voyage. At last, Karl Mære, a celebrated
pirate, offered his services; left Norway, and arrived at
Thorshaven safely. He commenced collecting the tribute,
and succeeded until he was himself compelled to pay a
capitation tax. He was decapitated, and his companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>returned without the money. Had the “wanderer” in
Iceland been favored with the office of collector, he might
perhaps have visited Faroe; and, in that case, he probably
would not much longer have continued a <span class='fss'>WANDERING
BACHELOR</span>.</p>

<p class='c013'>T<span class='fsvs'>HE</span> mythology of the Northmen is so intimately connected
with their literature, that any notice of the one
would be incomplete without some reference to the other.
The whole system is as complicated and ingenious, and
quite as interesting, as the mythology of the Greeks and
Romans. At the dawning of time, according to the Scandinavian
theory, there were two primitive worlds,—M<span class='fsvs'>USPELL</span>,
or M<span class='fsvs'>USPELHEIM</span>, and N<span class='fsvs'>IFLHEIM</span>. Muspell was located
in the south, or <em>above</em>; and Niflheim, <em>below</em>, or in the
north. Muspell is the world of light and fire. On its
border, guarding it, sits S<span class='fsvs'>URTUR</span>, the god of the flaming
sword, and chief of the chaotic demons. At the period of
R<span class='fsvs'>AGNAROK</span>, or end of time, Surtur comes forth with his
flaming falchion, enters the last great battle, vanquishes all
the gods, and consumes the universe with fire.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> N<span class='fsvs'>IFLHEIM</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>or the world below, is the region of cold and darkness; and
in the middle of it is the fountain Hvergelmir, from which
flow twelve rivers.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Between Muspell, above, and Niflheim,
below, was a wide chaotic space, known as G<span class='fsvs'>INNUNGAGAP</span>.
In this space, as will be seen, the earth was formed and
peopled. The part of Ginnungagap towards the north, was
filled with vast piles of congealed vapor from the rivers of
Niflheim. The part towards the south was full of sparks
from Muspell.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> When the congealed vapor was met by the
heat and sparks, it melted into drops; and, “by the might
of him who sent the heat,” the drops quickened into life,
and put on human form.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> This being, so made, was called
Ymir; and from him the Frost-giants are descended.
There was also formed from the drops of vapor, a cow named
Audhumla, and on the milk of this cow Ymir subsisted.
From the stones that the cow licked, there sprang a man
who was endowed with agility, power, and beauty. This
man was called Bur, and he had a son named Bör, who
took for his wife Besla, the daughter of the giant Bölthorn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Bör had three sons, O<span class='fsvs'>DIN</span>,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
V<span class='fsvs'>ILI</span>, and V<span class='fsvs'>E</span>; though the two
latter are usually considered as attributes of Odin himself.
The sons of Bör slew the giant Ymir; and so much blood
flowed from his body, that all the race of Frost-giants were
drowned in it, except one—Bergelmir—who, with his wife,
escaped on board of his bark. From these two all the
Frost-giants, or race of Jötuns, are descended.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The sons of Bör dragged the body of Ymir into the
middle of Ginnungagap, and from it formed the earth.
From his blood they made the ocean, which encompassed
the earth on every side, like a broad ring. Out of his flesh
they made the land, and from his bones the mountains;
from his hair they formed the trees, and with his teeth and
jaws, and some pieces of broken bones, they made stones
and pebbles. Of his skull they formed the arched heavens,
which they raised over the earth; and in the four quarters
of the heavens, like four sentries on the watch, they placed
four dwarfs,—East, West, North, and South<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a>—and there
they keep their places, and bear up the sky. The brains of
Ymir they threw in the air, and of these the clouds were
formed. The earth, or Midgard,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> was represented as level
and circular, and midway between Muspell, above, and
Niflheim, below. Around the outer edge, next to the ocean,
the sons of Bör raised a bulwark of Ymir’s eyebrows, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>protection against the Jötuns. Outside of Midgard, flows
the great ocean; and beyond this, in another circle, is
Jötunheim,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> the land of the Jötuns, a rough mountain
waste.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most intricate and sublime conceptions,
is the myth of the ash Yggdrasill. This tree is typical of
nature, and intimately connected with and partly supporting
the earth. The branches of this tree extend over the whole
world, and reach above heaven. It has three roots, which
are very wide asunder. One springs from the region of the
Frost-giants, in Jötunheim; the second, from Niflheim; and
the third is in heaven. The second root, in Niflheim,
is gnawed by the great dragon Nidhogg; and under it is
the fountain Hvergelmir, whence flow the twelve great
rivers. Under the root of the ash that is in heaven, is the
holy Urdar-fount, where the gods sit in judgment. Under
the root in Jötunheim is Mimir’s well, and in this well
wisdom lies concealed. All who desire wisdom or knowledge,
must drink of the water of this well. The Jötuns are
represented as older than the gods, and in consequence they
look deeper into the past. For this reason, the gods must
go to the Jötuns for knowledge. Odin came to Mimir one
day, and asked for a draught of water from the well; but
Mimir would not furnish it, till he left one of his eyes
in pledge. In the branches of the ash sits an eagle that
knows many things; and the squirrel Ratatösk runs up and
down the tree, bearing words of strife between the eagle and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the dragon Niddhogg at the root. Four harts run over the
branches of the tree, and bite off the buds.</p>

<p class='c013'>From earth to heaven is a bridge called Bifröst, or the
rainbow. Over this bridge the gods ride on horseback,
every day, going to and from their judgment-seat in heaven.
Their horses all have names. The most celebrated is
Sleipnir, the horse of Odin. He is a beautiful gray color,
has eight legs, and excells all horses ever possessed by gods
or men. This famous steed, as will be seen hereafter, when
ridden by Hermod the Nimble, once sprang over the gates
of Hel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gods, or race of Æ<span class='fsvs'>SIR</span>, live in Asgard, a city in
heaven, in the center of the universe. O<span class='fsvs'>DIN</span>, the first and
eldest of the Æsir, is at the head, governs all things, and all
the other deities obey him, as children do a father. He is
the highest, the supreme deity, and is supposed to be the
progenitor of all the other gods; and, on this account, is
called A<span class='fsvs'>LL</span>-<span class='fsvs'>FATHER</span>.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Seated on his throne Hlidskjalf, he
sees throughout the world, and comprehends all things.
His mansion, called Valaskjalf, was built by the gods, and
has a roof of pure silver. Odin is represented seated on his
throne, with a spear in his right hand, and on each side his
two wolves, Geri and Freki. On his shoulders are his two
ravens, who fly abroad throughout the earth during the day,
and return at night, and give him tidings of all that is
going on. They are named H<span class='fsvs'>UGIN</span> and M<span class='fsvs'>UNIN</span>, or <em>Thought</em>
and <em>Memory</em>; and nothing transpires but what is caught up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>by them, and whispered in the ear of Odin. All the meat
that is set before him, he gives to his wolves, for wine to
him is both meat and drink. As related in the Edda:<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

armed with a mallet called Mjölnir, has a belt of strength

is fighting the Jötuns, with whom he is at perpetual
war. With his gauntlets on his hands—without which he
cannot grasp his weapon—he hurls at them his terrible
mallet, and crushes in their skulls. He is favorable to the
race of men, and keeps watch in Midgard—the home of
man, or Manheim—and defends them from the giants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Jötunheim. He has two sons, Modi and Magni. Thor is

<p class='c013'>Thor’s home is Thrudvang—the home of strength—and
his mansion is called Bilskirnir. This is “the largest house
ever built,” and contains five hundred and forty halls.
Thor’s marvelous exploits, his combats with the enemies of
mankind—the Jötuns and the Midgard serpent—are favorite
themes with all the old Icelandic writers. Though Thor
is the son of Odin, he is not always considered as his inferior.
Temples for the separate worship of Thor, and statues
dedicated to him, were erected in various parts of Scandinavia.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next god in rank, is B<span class='fsvs'>ALDUR</span>, the second son of
Odin.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> He is represented as fair in form and feature, as
universally beloved, and the mildest, the wisest, and
most eloquent of all the Æsir. Such is his nature, that his
judgment once pronounced, can never be altered. His hair
is supremely fair, and in allusion to it, a beautiful plant that
is almost white—the <em>Anthemis Cotula</em>—is called Baldur’s
Eyebrow.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Baldur dwells in the mansion called Breidablik,
one of the fairest in heaven. Nothing impure or unclean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>can enter it. His wife is N<span class='fsvs'>ANNA</span>, the daughter of Nep.
The myth of Baldur’s death, is one of the most beautiful in
the Northern Mythology. All the deities, as well as men,
joined in his praise; and at his death, the whole universe
was in mourning.</p>

<p class='c013'>F<span class='fsvs'>ORSETI</span>, the son of Baldur and Nanna, is the god of
Righteousness, and presides over Justice. He possesses the
heavenly mansion called Glitnir, the walls, columns, and
beams of which are of solid gold, and the roof pure silver.
He reconciles all disputants at law; those bringing their
cases before him never failing to find perfect satisfaction in
his decisions.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>B<span class='fsvs'>RAGI</span>, the son of Odin, is the god of Poetry: hence the
art of poetry is called <em>Bragr</em>. Bragi has a flowing beard,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
and is noted for his eloquence, and the correct use of language.
His wife is I<span class='fsvs'>DUNA</span>, the goddess of Eternal Youth.
She is entrusted with the keeping of the apples which the
gods, on feeling old, have only to taste, to become young
again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Æ<span class='fsvs'>GIR</span> is the deity of the Ocean, though a Jötun, and
not reckoned with the Æsir. His wife is R<span class='fsvs'>AN</span>; and with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>net she catches unfortunate mariners. Ægir entertains all
the Æsir, at a grand feast of the gods given at the autumnal
equinox.</p>

<p class='c013'>N<span class='fsvs'>JORD</span>, who dwells in the heavenly region called Noatun,
rules over the winds and the waves, and checks the fury
of the elements, the sea, and the fire. His aid is invoked
by fishermen and sea-farers. The wife of Njord is S<span class='fsvs'>KADI</span>,
the daughter of a Jötun. Njord and Skadi have two children;
F<span class='fsvs'>REY</span>, a son, and a daughter named F<span class='fsvs'>REYJA</span>. Frey is
one of the most celebrated and beloved of all the gods.
He rides in a car drawn by a boar, presides over the rain,
the sunshine, and the fruits of the earth. His aid is invoked
for good harvests, and also for peace; and he dispenses
wealth to those who do him honor.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Frey fell violently in
love with Gerda, one of the most beautiful of all the women,
and ordered Skirnir, his trusty messenger, to go and
ask her hand for him. Skirnir promised to do so if Frey
would give him his sword, a weapon of such a rare quality,
that it would strew a field with slain, at the bidding of its
owner. Impatient for the possession of Gerda, he gave
Skirnir the sword; and afterwards, in a battle with Beli, he
slew him with the antlers of a stag. In the last great battle,
where all of the gods are engaged, Frey is without a
weapon.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>H<span class='fsvs'>EIMDAL</span>—called also the White god—is a sacred and
powerful deity, the son of nine Jötun virgins, who were sisters.
He is called Gold-toothed, his teeth being of pure
gold. He dwells in Himinbjorg, at the end of Bifröst, and
has a famous horse named Gulltopp. He is the warder or
sentry of the gods, and therefore was placed on the borders
of heaven, to prevent the Jötuns from forcing their way over
the bridge. His ear is so acute, that no sound escapes
him; he can even hear the grass grow, or the wool on the
backs of sheep. He requires less sleep than a bird, sees a
hundred miles around him on every side, and by night as
well as by day. In time of danger, or when he wishes to
call the gods together, he blows a blast on his Gjallar-horn,
that sounds throughout all worlds; and the gods immediately
assemble.</p>

<p class='c013'>H<span class='fsvs'>ÖDUR</span> is a deity who is blind, but possesses great
strength. He is more fully described in the account of Baldur’s
death.</p>

<p class='c013'>V<span class='fsvs'>IDAR</span>, surnamed the Silent, and noted for his heavy
shoes, is the son of Odin and the Jötun-woman Grida. He
possesses immense strength, being nearly as strong as Thor
himself. Great reliance is placed on him in cases of emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>V<span class='fsvs'>ALI</span>, the son of Odin and Rinda, is most valiant in
war; and, in his youth, was as precocious as the Mercury of
the ancients. He slew Hödur, the murderer of Baldur, before
he was a day old.</p>

<p class='c013'>U<span class='fsvs'>LLUR</span>, the son of Sif, and step-son of Thor, has great
skill in the use of the bow. His name signifies the White,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>or the Wool-like. He favors the winter, and travels with
great speed on skates and snow-shoes. He is very handsome,
has every quality of a warrior, and is often invoked by
those who engage in single combat. Vidar and Vali will
survive the destruction of the world by the fire of Surtur,
and dwell on the plain of Ida, where Asgard formerly stood.
Thither shall come to meet them, Modi and Magni, the sons
of Thor, bringing with them their father’s mallet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the goddesses, F<span class='fsvs'>RIGA</span>, the wife of Odin, is the highest.
Her mansion is called Fensalir. The next in rank is
S<span class='fsvs'>AGA</span>, the goddess of History. Her house is Sökkvabek,
and is of great size. The goddess E<span class='fsvs'>IR</span> presides over the art
of Healing.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> G<span class='fsvs'>EFJON</span> is a maid, and all who die maids go
to her, and become her hand-maidens. F<span class='fsvs'>ULLA</span> is also a
maid. She has beautiful hair that flows over her shoulders,
and a gold ribbon adorns her head. She is an attendant
and confidant of Friga, and is entrusted with her secrets.
F<span class='fsvs'>REYJA</span> is the wife of Odur; and they have a daughter,
Hnossa, who is celebrated for her beauty. Odur travels
through distant countries; and, in his absence, Freyja
weeps, and her tears are pure gold. As she goes over the
world in search of her husband, the people give her different
names. She rides in a chariot drawn by two cats. The
goddess L<span class='fsvs'>OFNA</span> is mild in her demeanor, and takes delight
in smoothing the path of lovers, and promoting the success
and union of those who are sincerely attached to each other.
V<span class='fsvs'>ORA</span> is a goddess that punishes lovers’ false vows and perjuries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>G<span class='fsvs'>NA</span> is the messenger of Friga, and is sent by her
on various errands through different worlds. She has a
horse called Hófvarpnir, that can travel through water or air.
Besides these, there are many other goddesses whose duty it
is to serve in Valhalla, wait on the gods, take care of their
drinking horns, &amp;c. These are called the Valkyrjor.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
Odin sends the Valkyrjor to every battle-field, to decide who
shall be slain, and declare on which side victory shall rest.
They carry the spirits of the slain to Odin, in Valhalla.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the inferior deities are three maidens called
Norns. Their names are Urd, Vernandi, and Skuld; or, Past,
Present, and Future. They preside over the birth and destinies
of men, and determine their fate and length of life. There
are also other Norns besides these three. Some of them
are of heavenly origin, and dispense good destinies. Others
are of the races of elves, or evil spirits; and men who meet
with numerous misfortunes are said to be under the influence
of evil Norns. There is also a class of inferior beings
known as Dwarfs. They dwell in caves and caverns of the
earth.</p>

    <div>SCANDINAVIAN MYTHOLOGY CONCLUDED.—ADVENTURES OF THOR, AND THE DEATH OF BALDUR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>N<span class='fsvs'>EARLY</span> all the deities have been noticed. The origin
of night and day, and the sun and moon are thus given.
The giant Njörvi, who dwelt in Jötunheim, had a daughter
called Night,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> who, like all of her race, was of a dark and
swarthy complexion. Night married a man named Annar,
and had a daughter called Earth.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> She next espoused
Delling, one of the Æsir; and their son was Day,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> a child
light and beauteous like its father. Odin then gave to
Night and her son Day two horses and two cars, and set
them up in the heavens, to drive successively one after the
other round the world in twelve hours’ time. Night goes
first, driving the horse Hrimfaxi; and he, every morn, as he
ends his course, bedews the earth with foam that falls from
his bit. Day follows with his horse Skinfaxi; and from his
mane light is shed over the earth and the heavens. The
man Mundilfari had two children so lovely and graceful
that he called the boy Máni (moon), and the girl Sol (sun).
The gods, being angry at the man’s presumption, placed his
children in the heavens. The bright and illuminated car of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the sun, which the gods made out of the sparks that fell
from Muspelheim, to give light to the world, was drawn by
the horses Arvak and Alsvid, and driven by Sól. Máni was
set to direct the moon in his course, and guide his increasing
and waning aspect. Two wolves, Sköll and Hati, are constantly
in pursuit of the sun and moon; and it is on this
account that they fly so swiftly through the heavens. One
day these wolves will overtake and devour them.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the gods is named L<span class='fsvs'>OKI</span>; and to him is ascribed
nearly all the evil that is suffered in the world. He was the
calumniator of the Æsir, the contriver of frauds and mischief,
and the disgrace of both gods and men. He had a
terrible offspring by Angurbodi, a giantess of Jötunheim.
These were, the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard serpent, and Hela,
or Death. The wolf Fenrir could only be fed by T<span class='fsvs'>YR</span>, the
god of Bravery, who, as will be seen, was called the one-handed.
Tyr is the most daring and intrepid of the gods.
He dispenses valor in battle, and his aid is invoked by warriors.
The gods were warned by the oracles, that the
power of the wolf was becoming dangerous; and Tyr attempted
to make a fetter to bind him. The first trial failed,
the wolf snapping the cords asunder as if they had been
threads. Tyr next made the fetter called Gleipnir, fashioning
it out of six things; namely, the noise made out of the
foot-fall of a cat, the beards of women, the roots of stones,
the sinews of bears, the breath of fish, and the spittle of birds.
Though this cord was as fine and soft as silk, the wolf would
not consent to be bound with it, unless Tyr would let
him take one of his hands in his mouth. To this he consented;
and the gods then bound the wolf; and, finding he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>could not free himself by breaking the fetter, he revenged
himself by biting off the right hand of Tyr. When the offspring
of Loki were born, Odin sent for them; and after
having the wolf put in fetters, threw the Midgard serpent
into the ocean that surrounded the earth. Here the monster
grew to such size that he encircled the whole earth,
with his tail in his mouth. H<span class='fsvs'>ELA</span> (Death) was cast by Odin
into Niflheim; and her abode is known as Helheim, or Hel.
Her habitation is surrounded by exceedingly high walls, and
strongly-barred gates. Her hall is called Elvidmir; Hunger
is her table; Starvation, her knife; Delay, her man;
Slowness, her maid; Precipice, her threshold; Care, her
bed; and Burning Anguish forms the hanging of her apartments.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spirits of those who fell in battle, were carried at
once to Odin, in Valhalla—the hall of the slain; and on
this account Odin is called Val-father, or father of the slain.
Those who die a natural death, or of old age, were taken to
Hel. These abodes, however, were not of eternal duration,
but only continued until Ragnarok—the final judgment and
destruction of the earth and all material things. Valhalla
is not represented as a place of unalloyed happiness, nor
Hel of continued misery; yet the former was far the most
desirable abode. The joys of Valhalla are imagined and
pictured on the basis of all our ideas of happiness in another
world—the highest degree of felicity known in this.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The joys and employments in Valhalla, will consist of
eating, drinking, and fighting. The spirits of the slain will
roam through the vast hall, and eat and drink with the
Æsir. The whole celestial banquet will consist of ale, and
the flesh of one wild boar, which, being cut off every day,
renews itself every night. The goddesses, or women, wait
at table, and fill the drinking horns. When the morning
repast is over, they all ride out into the plain, and fight, and
cut one another to pieces. They are, however, perpetually
renewed; and, towards evening, all resume their usual form,
and return to drink ale together. Valhalla was of immense
size, had five hundred and forty doors, and was spacious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>enough to contain the Æsir, and all the brave spirits that
Odin called to him from earth. In all the accounts of Hel
and Valhalla, to be found in the ancient Eddas, there is
nothing that goes to prove that the Scandinavians believed
in a place of eternal punishment. One or two brief passages
from the Younger Edda are quoted, to show that such
was the case; but these are proved to have been interpolations
in the manuscript of the Edda, by a modern christian
writer.</p>

<p class='c013'>An early period is spoken of, called the Golden Age.
Odin had constructed a court, or hall, of great magnificence.
It was resplendent on all sides, within and without, with the
finest gold. He appointed rulers or judges, to judge with
him the fate of men; and in the hall he had twelve seats
for them, besides his own throne. This court of justice was
called Gladsheim. Another edifice, a very fair structure,
was erected for the goddesses. This was called Vingolf.
Lastly, a smithy was built, and furnished with hammers,
tongs, anvils, and all manner of tools for working in wood,
stone, and metal. All the movable things belonging to the
gods, were made of gold; and from this the period was
known as the Golden Age.</p>

<p class='c013'>The age lasted until women arrived from Jötunheim,
and corrupted it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The exploits of Thor form the subjects of the most
lengthy and characteristic legends in the mythology of the
Scandinavians. At one time Ægir, the ocean deity, entertained
all the gods in Asgard, giving them a great feast, at
the period of the autumnal equinox. He furnished enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>to eat, but drink was greatly wanting; for he had no vessel
large enough to brew ale for such a numerous company.
Thor hearing that the giant Hymir owned a famous cauldron
of great size, he, in company with Tyr, set out for
Jötunheim, to obtain it, determined either by fair means or
foul to carry it away. After various adventures he gets it,
claps it on his head like a huge hat, and walks off with it,
the ears of the cauldron reaching down to his heels! The
giants follow and attack him; but he slays them all with
his terrible mallet. Having obtained the cauldron, Ægir
brewed as much ale as was required; and Loki, Thor, and
all the company, have a regular drinking bout. It ended
as such scenes usually do—in a fight; and Loki killed one
of Ægir’s servants, for which he was expelled by the gods,
and kicked out of doors. He was afterwards, however,
restored to his place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thor and Loki had a famous journey to Jötunheim, the
land of the giants. Thor, as usual, rode in his car drawn
by two goats; and when night came they put up at the
cottage of a peasant, both the travelers assuming the form
and costume of men. Thor killed his goats, and after flaying
them, put them in a kettle to cook for their supper, and
asked the peasant and his family to partake with him.
The peasant’s son was named Thjálfi, and the daughter
Röskva. Thor told them to throw all the bones into the
goats’ skins, which were spread out on the floor; but Thjálfi
broke one of the bones to get at the marrow. The next
morning, Thor raised his mallet, consecrated the goats’ skins,
and they instantly assumed their usual form, alive and well
and ready to pursue the journey; but one of the goats was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>found to be lame in one leg. To appease the anger of
Thor, the peasant offered any thing he possessed as a compensation.
Thor chose both his children; and ever after
Thjálfi the Nimble and Röskva the Quick were his attendants.
They then continued their journey, passed out of
Mannheim, crossed a broad ocean, and entered a deep forest.
They saw a large hall, and, entering it, went to sleep in a
deep room at one end. During the night, there was an
earthquake and a terrible roaring, which shook the whole
edifice. In the morning they found a giant of enormous
size, sleeping and snoring near them; and the vast edifice
was his glove which he had thrown off, and they had slept
in the thumb of it. The giant’s name was Skrymir, and
when he awoke he knew Thor at once and called him by
name. He offered to carry the wallet of provisions and
relieve Thjálfi, and after breakfast they journeyed together.
Thor, wishing to get rid of his new fellow-traveler, when
night arrived, hurled his mallet at him after he was asleep;
and it was buried deep in his skull. Waking up, the giant
asked if a leaf had fallen on his head. He slept again, and
Thor made two more efforts—once his mallet going deep
into his cheek; and again, burying it in his head up to the
handle. The giant merely put up his hand and asked if a
bit of moss or an acorn had fallen on him. He soon, however,
left Thor, and pursued his journey to the north. The
travelers arrived at the city of Utgard, situated in a vast
plain, and immediately paid their respects to Utgard-Loki,
the king. His majesty looked at the Thunderer with great
contempt, called him a stripling, and said if he was not mistaken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>it must be Aku-Thor. The king challenged Thor
and his companions to try various feats of skill and strength
with his subjects, the giants of Jötunheim. Loki sat down
to a trough filled with meat, and to eat a race with a giant;
but he got vanquished, his competitor eating the most, and
swallowing bones and all. Thor then produced Thjálfi to
run a race, and he was completely distanced. Thor himself
then attempted a drinking bout with the giants; but
at three long pulls he could not empty a single horn. He
then tried his hand at lifting; but though the giants only
furnished a common gray cat to be lifted, Thor could not
raise him from the ground, only lifting one foot a short distance.
Then he tried wrestling; but though his competitor
was a wrinkled old woman, he could not throw her, but
came near being thrown himself. Thor confessed that he
was vanquished, and turned his steps away, being accompanied
without the walls of the city by his majesty Utgard-Loki,
in person. Then the king tells Thor that, if he has
his way, the god shall never come into his place again, for
he fears him and only got the better of him that time by
stratagem. He said it was he that met him in the forest,
and he had a mountain before him when he slept; and if
Thor would see it on his return, he would observe two deep
vallies where he buried his mallet, while he thought he
struck Utgard himself. The two immense glens that could
be seen in the mountain were but the dints of Thor’s mallet.
In the contest of eating, the competitor of Loki was Fire itself,
that consumed all before it. Thjálfi ran a race with Hugi—Thought—which
flies faster than the fleetest being that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>is created. The old woman who wrestled with Thor was
Old Age, which could in time lay every thing low. What
appeared to be a cat, was the great Midgard serpent, that
encompassed the whole earth. The horn he drank from
extended to the sea itself; and in this he performed a most
prodigious feat, for he settled it greatly, as could be seen,
and which was called the ebb. Thor, on hearing how he
had been vanquished by stratagem, raised his mallet to
strike down the giant; but on turning, he had disappeared,
and, instead of a city near by, he saw nothing but a vast
plain. This was the end of Thor’s adventures in Jötunheim.
Then to reëstablish his reputation, Thor went out
to fish for the great Midgard serpent. He took no companions,
not even his car or goats. He traveled in the guise
of a young man, and put up at the house of a giant
named Hymir, who was going fishing; and he asked Thor
to provide some bait. He went into a herd of the giant’s
oxen, and seizing the largest bull, wrung off his head; and
returning with it, the two put off to sea together. They
rowed much further than the giant had ever gone before;
and Thor, baiting a hook and line of great strength with the
head of the bull, cast it out. The Midgard serpent immediately
swallowed it, and Thor drew upon him. The scene
was now most dreadful. Thor pulled so hard that his feet
broke through the boat, and went down to the bottom of
the sea. Thor darted looks of ire at the serpent, and he in
turn spouted floods of venom upon him. The giant turned
pale with fright, took out his knife and cut the line, when
the serpent sunk under water. Thor then grasped his mallet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>and hurled it at the monster; but he was low down in
the sea, and escaped, though some say his head was struck
off at the bottom of the ocean. Thor then, with his fist,
hit the giant a blow under the ear that knocked him out of
sight; and then, with rapid strides, he waded ashore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Baldur the Good having dreamed that harm was to
come to him, Friga, his mother, hearing of it, exacted an
oath from every thing, animate and inanimate, stones, trees,
fire, metals, and all living things, that they would not hurt
Baldur. One thing only was omitted—the misletoe. It was
then a favorite amusement for Baldur to stand up, and
have the Æsir throw at him their darts, javelins, battle-axes,
and other missiles; for none could harm him. Loki, under
the guise of an old woman, hearing that the misletoe had
not taken the oath, gathered a branch, and calling Hödur,
the blind god, told him to hurl it at Baldur, saying he
would guide his arm, and it being only a twig, it could not
hurt him. Hödur threw it, under the guidance of Loki;
and Baldur the Good was slain. The gods were speechless
with horror, looked at each other, and broke out into violent
lamentations of grief. Odin was most sensible of the great
loss the Æsir had suffered; and Friga asked who would
gain her love and good will by riding to Hel, and trying to
find Baldur, and offer to Hela a ransom for his return to
Asgard. Hermod offered his services, and left, mounted on
Odin’s famous horse, Sleipnir. While Hermod was on this
mission, Baldur’s body was borne to the sea shore to be
burnt. His ship Hringhorn, the largest in the world, was
required for a funeral pile; but no one could move it, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>they sent to Jötunheim for a famous giantess named
Hyrrokin. She came mounted on a wolf, with twisted
serpents for a bridle, and with one push moved the vessel as
they wanted it. Baldur’s body was borne to the funeral
pile on board the ship; and the ceremony had such an
effect on Nanna, that she died of grief, and her body was
burned on the same pile with her husband’s. Thor
hallowed the pile with his mallet, and during the ceremony
kicked a dwarf into the fire, because he ran before him.
At Baldur’s obsequies was a vast concourse. First, there
was Odin, with Friga, the valkyrjor, and his ravens; then
Frey, in his car drawn by the boar with golden bristles.
Heimdall rode his horse, Gulltopp; Freyja drove in her
chariot drawn by cats. There were also present many
Frost-giants and giants of the mountains. Baldur’s horse,
fully caparisoned, was burned along with the body of his
master.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hermod pursued his journey till he arrived at the gates
of Hel, and found them barred. He alighted, tightened the
girths, mounted, put spurs to the horse, and at one leap
sprang over the gate without touching. He found Baldur
occupying the most distinguished seat in the hall; and after
spending a night with him, asked Hela (death) to let
Baldur return to Asgard. She said she would consent
to it, provided Baldur was so beloved that every thing
would weep for him. Hermod then returned, bearing a
gold ring as a present to Odin from Baldur, and some
valuable gifts from Nanna to Friga. Every thing wept for
Baldur, except one old woman, who refused. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>found to be Loki in disguise, who never ceased to work evil
among the Æsir. To escape the wrath of the gods, Loki
changed himself into a salmon, was pursued down a river,
and in leaping a net was caught by Thor in his hands. The
gods then confined him in a cavern, with a serpent directly
over him; and as the venom drops on him, he writhes and
howls, and this makes that shaking of the earth that men
call earthquakes. Loki’s two children were taken, and one
changed to a wolf; and he immediately devoured the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end of all material things is known as Ragnarök,—the
twilight of the gods, and conflagration of the universe.
The world becomes corrupt; a wolf devours the sun, and
another wolf the moon; trees fall, and mountains tumble to
pieces. The wolf Fenrir opens his enormous mouth, the
lower jaw being on the earth, and the upper reaching to
heaven; the Midgard serpent gains the land, and heaven is
cleft in twain. The sons of Muspell ride through the breach,
led by Surtur, in the midst of flaming fire. Bifröst breaks
in pieces, and a vast assemblage gathers on the battle-field of
Vigrid, which is a hundred miles long. Heimdall stands
up, and, with all his might, blows a blast on the Gjallar-horn,
which arouses all the gods. Odin asks advice of
Mimir; the Æsir, and all the heroes of Valhalla, led by the
All-father, go forth to the field of battle. The ash, Yggdrasill,
begins to shake; a dissolution of all things is at hand.
Odin places himself against the wolf Fenrir, and Thor encounters
the Midgard serpent. Frey meets Surtur, and they
exchange terrible blows; but Frey falls, as he has been without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>his trusty sword ever since he fell in love with Gerda.
The dog, Garm, that had been chained in a cave, breaks
loose, and attacks Tyr, and they kill each other. Thor slays
the Midgard serpent, thereby gaining great renown; but,
retiring nine paces, he falls dead on the spot, being suffocated
with the venom that the dying serpent throws over him.
Odin is swallowed by the wolf; and Vidar, coming up, with
his foot on the lower jaw and his hand on the upper, he tears
the animal’s jaws apart, and rends him till he dies. Loki
and Heimdall fight, and kill each other. This most terrible
battle being over, Surtur darts fire and flame over the world,
and the whole universe is consumed by it. A heaven, and
many abodes, both good and bad, are supposed to exist after
this; for the spirits of all who have lived are immortal. A
new earth, most lovely and verdant, shall rise out of the sea,
and grain shall grow unsown. During the conflagration, a
woman named Lif (Life) and a man named Lifthrasir, lie
concealed in Hodmimir’s forest. They feed on morning
dew, and their descendants soon cover the earth again. Vidar
and Vali survive the conflagration, and dwell on the plain
of Ida, where Asgard formerly stood. Thither went the
sons of Thor, Modi and Magni, carrying with them their
father’s mallet, Mjölnir. Baldur and Hödur repaired thither
from the abode of death (Hel) and there they hold converse
on their past perils and adventures. A famous ship, called
Skidbladnir, is spoken of, that is so large that it would hold
all the Æsir, and their weapons. It was built by the
dwarfs, and presented to Frey; and, being constructed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>many pieces and with great skill, when not wanted Frey
could fold it up like a piece of cloth and put it in his pocket.
In the language of the Edda,</p>

    <div>EARLY LITERATURE OF THE ICELANDERS—EDDAS AND SAGAS—MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PERIOD—EXTRACTS FROM THE POETIC EDDA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A<span class='fsvs'>CCORDING</span> to the system of the Northmen, man and
woman were the last and most perfect productions of the
creative power. After the Æsir, the Jötuns and the Dwarfs
had a being. Odin and two other deities were walking on
the sea-shore, and came to two trees, and from them they
made the first man, A<span class='fsvs'>SK</span>, and the first woman, E<span class='fsvs'>MBLA</span>.
They had allotted to them, for a residence, Midgard, which,
from being the home of man, was called Mannheim; and
from these two, Ask and Embla, are descended the whole
human race. Some time after this, Heimdal, the warder
and trumpeter of the gods, wandered over the earth under
the name of Rigr. He was received and hospitably entertained
by the descendants of Ask and Embla; first by Ai—Great
Grandfather,—and Edda—Great Grandmother,—who dwelt
in a lowly hut; next by Afi—Grandfather,—and Amma—Grandmother,—living
in a comfortable habitation; and,
lastly, by Father and Mother,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> who occupied a splendid
mansion. The deity, by his beneficent presence, infuses a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>vital energy into his hosts; and, in due time after his departure,
Edda, Amma, and Mother, each give birth to a son.
The infants are sprinkled with water at the moment of their
birth: Edda’s son is called Thræll—<em>Thrall</em>; Amma’s, Karl—<em>Churl</em>;
and Mother’s, Jarl, or <em>Noble</em>; and these three,
Thrall, Churl, and Noble, have each a numerous offspring.
Here is an aristocratic explanation of the three castes that
appear, at an early period, to have formed the frame-work of
Scandinavian society,—the thralls, or slaves; the churls, or
free peasants—odalsmen, as they were afterwards termed;
and the nobles. The poet, in his Edda,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> describes the
thralls as having black hair, an unsightly countenance, uncouth
appearance, and of low and deformed stature; physiological
traits characteristic of the Lapps, who were probably
reduced to a state of vassalage by their Scandinavian conquerors.
The destiny of the thralls is to toil incessantly, in
order that by their labor the churls may obtain sufficient
produce from the earth to enable the nobles to live with
becoming splendor. The poet shows his contempt for this
class, by giving Thrall’s sons such names as Frousy, Stumpy,
Plumpy, Sootyface, Slowpace, Homespun, &amp;c., and calling
his daughters Lazybody, Cranefoot, Smokynose, and Tearclout.
Among the churls, sons of Karl, we find such names
as Stiffbeard, Husbandman, Holder (of land), and Smith;
the daughters being designated Prettyface, Swanlike, Blithespeech,
Chatterbox, &amp;c. The poet, though, reserves the
most of his eloquence for the nobles, who, he says, have fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>hair, a clear complexion, and fine piercing eyes; their sole
avocations being to wield the sword, dart the javelin, rein
the fiery steed, chase the deer, and other elegant amusements,
which Jarl’s descendants still delight to astonish the churls
with. Jarl—equivalent to Earl—marries Erna—Lively—the
daughter of Hersir—Baron; but the poet only gives the
names of the sons; names that usually designate relationship,
as Cousin, Nephew, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c013'>The literary history of Iceland, in the early ages of the
republic, is of a most interesting character. When we consider
the limited population of the country, and the many
disadvantages under which they labored, their literature is
the most remarkable on record. The old Icelanders, from
the tenth to the sixteenth century, through a period in the
history of the world when little intellectual light beamed
from the surrounding nations, were as devoted and ardent
workers in the fields of history and poetry as any community
in the world, under the most favorable circumstances.
Previous to the present century, the learned world seemed
to consider the writings of the Icelanders as almost unworthy
of notice. With the discovery through old manuscripts
that the early voyages of the Icelanders extended to the
American coast, there was an interest aroused, and curiosity
was excited to learn the entire history of this energetic and
intellectual race. Springing from the old Norse, or Norwegian
stock, they carried the language and habits of their
ancestors with them to their island home. During a period
of nearly one thousand years, since the first settlement of the
country, the Icelandic has undergone less change—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>perhaps one exception—than any language now spoken.
Though a very large number of our English words are derived
direct from the Icelandic, yet the most learned and
indefatigable of our lexicographers, both in England and
America, have acknowledged their ignorance of this language.
Through the labors of Professors Rask, Rafn, and
Müller, M. Mallett, Mr. Finn Magnusen, and others, the language
and literature of this country is now open to us.</p>

<p class='c013'>The writings of the early Icelanders are principally
Eddas and Sagas. The Eddas are the heroic poems of the
day, and describe the deeds and prowess of heroes and warriors;
and some of them abound in mythological machinery
to an extent quite equal to the writings of Homer and Virgil.
The two principal Eddas are known as the Poetic, or <em>Elder</em>
Edda, and the <em>Younger</em>, or Prose Edda. The Sagas are
historical writings, give a picture of the public and private
life of the Icelanders, their manners and customs, feuds, combats,
voyages, and discoveries, biography of eminent persons,
and such a description of their national and social state, as
enables us to see the character and habits of the people
during the early years of the Icelandic Republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>The E<span class='fsvs'>LDER</span> E<span class='fsvs'>DDA</span> consists of thirty-nine poems, and is
ascribed to S<span class='fsvs'>ÆMUND</span> S<span class='fsvs'>IGFUSSON</span>, surnamed F<span class='fsvs'>RODE</span>, or, “the
<em>learned</em>.” He flourished at the close of the eleventh, and
beginning of the twelfth century; was educated at the Universities
of France and Germany, and returned to Iceland,
and became the parish priest of Oddi, a village near the foot
of Mt. Hekla. He devoted himself to the education of
youth, deciphering Runic manuscripts, and the cultivation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>letters. Some suppose that he was only the author of one
of these poems; that he found the others in manuscript, or
obtained them from oral tradition. In proof of this, one
only—the Sólar-ljóth—Lay of the Sun—contains the least
allusion to Christianity. All the others bear marks of greater
antiquity than the eleventh century.</p>

<p class='c013'>The P<span class='fsvs'>ROSE</span>, or Y<span class='fsvs'>OUNGER</span> E<span class='fsvs'>DDA</span>, was written many years
subsequent to the Elder Edda. It contains a complete system
of Scandinavian Mythology, all, or nearly all, derived
from the Elder.</p>

<p class='c013'>The account of the Mythology of the Northmen in the
former chapters, is principally from Mallett’s account of the
younger Edda,—Bishop Percy’s translation. Snorri Sturlason,
one of the most remarkable men in the annals of Iceland,
is said to be the writer and compiler of the younger
Edda. The prominent incidents of his life give a striking
picture of the manners of the age in which he lived. This
was several generations later than the time of Sæmund
Frode. Snorri was born at Hvam, in Myra Sysla, in the
year 1178. He was a historian and poet, as well as a powerful
political chieftain, and at one time the wealthiest man
in Iceland. During his life he was twice elected Supreme
Magistrate, or President of the Republic. At three years of
age, he was taken into the care of John Lopston, of Oddi,
grandson of Sæmund Frode, and lived with him till he was
twenty years of age. He flourished in a stormy period, and
led a turbulent and ambitious life. He received an excellent
education from his foster-father, and turned every favorable
circumstance to his own advantage. Appreciating the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>adage, that “money is power,” he married Herdisa, the
daughter of a priest called Bersi the Rich—a very enviable
surname, which, no doubt, enabled the reverend gentleman to
brave the bulls and decrees of popes and councils, and take
to himself a wife—who brought him a very considerable
fortune. If we judge by the career of Snorri, Christianity
had not, at this period, much improved the character of the
Icelanders. We have the same turbulent and sanguinary
scenes, the same loose conduct of the women, and the perfidy
and remorseless cruelty of the men, as in Pagan times.
Snorri lived twenty-five years with Herdisa, obtained a divorce,
married a rich heiress, quarreled with a son and
daughter of his first wife respecting pecuniary matters, had a
number of illegitimate, or, rather, adulterine children, and
was finally murdered by three of his sons-in-law and a step-son.
Three of his illegitimate daughters were married to
men of rank, and in more respects than one, were like the
daughters of Lear. Their husbands were obliged to get rid
of them by suing for legal divorces, on account of their loose
conduct. One of them, Ingjibjörg, married a second time,
but was again divorced, and became notorious, even in Iceland,
for her debaucheries.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> By his marriages, his learning,
shrewdness, and ambition, Snorri became the most wealthy
and powerful man in the country, and, for some time the
political head of the state. We are told that sometimes he
made his appearance at the national assembly with eight or
nine hundred men in his train. His ambition was literary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>as well as political, and his celebrity was not confined to his
own country. He visited Norway, composed and recited a
poem in praise of Hacon, a powerful jarl; and strengthened
his position at home by an alliance with neighboring chiefs
on the continent. Like the emperors of Rome, he constructed
a sumptuous bath of cut stone and cement, which,
to this day, is called <em>Snorri-laug</em>, or Snorri’s Bath. It is
circular, and spacious enough to swim in. It is supplied
with hot water from a spouting fountain or geyser, by a conduit
over five hundred feet in length. Though more than
six hundred years have passed since it was built, it is in good
repair at the present day, and has been used as a temporary
bathing-place by some modern travelers.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a period of unexampled prosperity, Snorri began
to experience the frowns of fortune. His avarice, ambition,
and turbulent disposition, made him unpopular at home,
and embroiled him in quarrels with neighboring chiefs and
rulers. Gissur Thorvaldsen, formerly his son-in-law, was
ordered by Hacon, king of Norway, to make him a prisoner,
and bring him before the king; and if he could not take him
alive, to bring him dead. Having an eye on his estates,
Thorvaldsen assassinated him, on the night of the 22d of
September, 1241, and immediately took possession of his
property. Snorri fell in the 63d year of his age. A letter
in the Runic character, was sent to him, a few hours before
his death, warning him of his danger; but we are told, notwithstanding
his great learning and extensive acquaintance
with the antiquities and literature of the country, that he
could not decipher it. In addition to his poetical and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>works, he was author and compiler of the H<span class='fsvs'>EIMSKRINGLA</span>, or
“Chronicle of the Kings of Norway,” a historical work of
great interest and celebrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A bare recital of the titles of the different poems forming
the Eddas, would be of little interest. One was entitled
the V<span class='fsvs'>ÖLUSPA</span>—<em>Völu-spá, The Song of the Prophetess</em>.
Another is the <em>Háva-mál</em>,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and contains a complete code of
Odinic morality; and, as will be seen by the following extracts,
translated by Bishop Percy, are, many of them, worthy
of a christian age and a christian people. We will
close this chapter, and our account of the Literature and
Mythology of the early Icelanders, by the following quotations
from the Old Eddaic poem, the H<span class='fsvs'>ÁVAMÁL</span>:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. Consider and examine well all your doors before you
venture to stir abroad; for he is exposed to continual danger,
whose enemies lie in ambush, concealed in his court.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. To the guest who enters your dwelling with frozen
knees, give the warmth of your fire; he who hath traveled
over the mountains, hath need of food and well-dried garments.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. Offer water to him who sits down at your table; for
he hath occasion to cleanse his hands; and entertain him
honorably and kindly, if you would win from him friendly
words, and a grateful return.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. He who traveleth hath need of wisdom. One may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>do at home whatsoever one will; but he who is ignorant of
good manners, will only draw contempt upon himself when
he comes to sit down with men well instructed.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. He who goes to a feast where he is not expected,
either speaks with a lowly voice, or is silent; he listens
with his ears, and is attentive with his eyes; by this he acquires
knowledge and wisdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>8. Happy he who draws upon himself the applause and
benevolence of men! for whatever depends upon the will of
others, is hazardous and uncertain.</p>

<p class='c013'>10. A man can carry with him no better provision for
his journey, than the strength of understanding. In a foreign
country, this will be of more use to him than treasures;
and will introduce him to the table of strangers.</p>

<p class='c013'>12&ndash;13. A man cannot carry a worse custom with him to
a banquet, than that of drinking too much; the more the
drunkard swallows the less is his wisdom, till he loses his
reason. The bird of oblivion sings before those who inebriate
themselves, and steals away their souls.</p>

<p class='c013'>16. A coward thinks he shall live forever, if he can but
keep out of the reach of arms; but though he should escape
every weapon, old age, that spares none, will give him
no quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>17. The gluttonous man, if he is not upon his guard,
eats his own death; and the gluttony of a fool makes the
wise man laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>21. The flocks know when to return to the fold, and to
quit the pasture; but the worthless and the slothful know
not how to restrain their gluttony.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>22. The lewd and dissolute man makes a mock of every
thing; not considering how much he himself is the object
of derision. No one ought to laugh at another until he is
free from faults himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>23. A man void of sense ponders all night long, and
his mind wanders without ceasing; but when he is weary at
the point of day, he is nothing wiser than he was over
night.</p>

<p class='c013'>32. Many are thought to be knit in the ties of sincere
kindness; but when it comes to the proof, how much are
they deceived! Slander is the common vice of the age.
Even the host backbites his guest.</p>

<p class='c013'>37. One’s own home is the best home, though never so
small. Every thing one eats at home is sweet. He who
lives at another man’s table, is often obliged to wrong his
palate.</p>

<p class='c013'>41. Let friends pleasure each other reciprocally with
presents of arms and habits. Those who give and those
who receive, continue a long time friends, and often give
feasts to each other.</p>

<p class='c013'>43. Love both your friends and your friends’ friends;
but do not favor the friend of your enemies.</p>

<p class='c013'>45. Hast thou a friend whom thou canst not well trust,
but wouldst make him useful to thee; speak to him with
bland words, but think craftily, and thus render him levity
for lies.</p>

<p class='c013'>47. When I was young, I wandered about alone; I
thought myself rich if I chanced to light upon a companion.
A man gives pleasure to another man.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>51. Peace, among the perfidious, continues for five
nights to shine bright as a flame; but when the sixth night
approaches, the flame waxes dim, and is quite extinguished;
then all their amity turns to hatred.</p>

<p class='c013'>55. Let not a man be over wise; neither let him be
more curious than he ought. Let him not seek to know his
destiny, if he would sleep secure and quiet.</p>

<p class='c013'>67. They invite me up and down to feasts, if I have only
need of a slight breakfast: my faithful friend is he who
will give me one loaf when he has but two.</p>

<p class='c013'>70. Whilst we live, let us live well; for be a man never
so rich when he lights his fire, death may perhaps enter his
door before it be burnt out.</p>

<p class='c013'>72. It is better to have a son late than never. One seldom
sees sepulchral stones raised over the graves of the
dead by any other hands but those of their own offspring.</p>

<p class='c013'>77. Riches pass away like the twinkling of an eye; of
all friends, they are the most inconstant. Flocks perish;
relations die; friends are not immortal; you will die yourself;
but I know one thing alone that is out of the reach of
fate; and that is the judgment which is passed upon the
dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>81. Praise the fineness of the day when it is ended;
praise a woman when she is buried; a sword when you
have proved it; a maiden after she is married; the ice
when once you have crossed it; and the liquor after it
is drunk.</p>

<p class='c013'>84. Trust not to the words of a girl, neither to those
which a woman utters; for their hearts have been made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>like the wheel that turns round; levity was put into their
bosoms.</p>

<p class='c013'>86&ndash;87. Trust not to the ice of one day’s freezing; neither
to the serpent that lies asleep; nor to the caresses of
her you are going to marry; nor to a sword that is cracked
or broken; nor to the son of a powerful man; nor to a field
that is newly sown.</p>

<p class='c013'>90. Peace between malicious women is compared to a
horse that is made to walk over the ice not properly shod;
or to a vessel in a storm without a rudder; or to a lame
man who should attempt to follow the mountain goats with
a young foal, or yearling mule.</p>

<p class='c013'>92. He who would make himself beloved by a maiden,
must entertain her with fine discourses, and offer her engaging
presents; he must also incessantly praise her beauty.
It requires good sense to be a skillful lover.</p>

<p class='c013'>95. The heart alone knows what passes within the heart,
and that which betrays the soul, is the soul itself. There is
no malady or sickness more severe than not to be content
with one’s lot.</p>

<p class='c013'>119. Never discover your uneasiness to an evil person,
for he will afford you no comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>121. Know that if you have a friend, you ought to visit
him often. The road is grown over with grass, the bushes
quickly spread over it, if it is not constantly traveled.</p>

<p class='c013'>123. Be not the first to break with your friend. Sorrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>gnaws the heart of him who has no one to advise with but
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>130. I advise you to be circumspect, but not too much:
be so, however, when you have drunk to excess, when you
are near the wife of another, and when you find yourself
among robbers.</p>

<p class='c013'>131. Do not accustom yourself to mocking; neither
laugh at your guest nor a stranger: they who remain at
home often know not who the stranger is that cometh to
their gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>136. Laugh not at the gray-headed declaimer, nor at
the aged grandsire. There often come forth from the wrinkles
of the skin, words full of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>140. The fire drives away diseases; Runic characters
destroy the effect of imprecations; the earth swallows up
inundations; and death extinguishes hatred and quarrels.</p>

<p class='c013'>T<span class='fsvs'>HE</span> modern literature of the Icelanders is of quite a different
character from that in heathen times, and in the early
history of the country, from the tenth to the sixteenth century.
They seem as much devoted to poetry as their ancestors,
and their style of versification is similar; but they court
the muse in a different strain. The poetry of the modern
Icelanders does not abound in mythology, hyperbole, and
fable; and it may reasonably be supposed that works of imagination
have lost something of the hue of romance that is
thrown around the productions of a heroic age. A study of
the works of foreign authors—translations from eminent
christian poets, in Norway, Germany, England, and the
United States, are favorite pursuits of the modern Icelanders;
and works of this description are among the most popular
published in the country.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the original writers and translators of the present
century, none rank as high as Jon Thorlakson. Receiving a
scanty salary of less than fifty dollars a year, as parish priest
of Bægisa, and laboring hard as a farmer, he yet found time
to translate from English and German writers, and to compose
original poetry, to the extent of several octavo volumes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>About the year 1818, his case attracted the attention of a
learned society in London, and a sum of money was forwarded
to him to smooth his declining years; but he survived
only till 1821, being over seventy years of age at the time
of his death. His translation of Milton was published in
Icelandic, in octavo—double columns—a volume of over
400 pages, in 1828. The “Essay on Man,” and a volume of
original poetry of great merit were published in 1842.
Among his original poems are two versions of the story of
Inkle and Yarico.</p>

<p class='c013'>The style of versification in vogue among the early Icelandic
writers was very peculiar. Its harmony was dependent,
not so much on rhyme and the number of syllables in
a line, as upon peculiar alliterations. Their language abounding
in consonants, this seemed easier than rhymes, which
were seldom used. Some of their kinds of verse had regular
alliterations at the commencement of the lines; other
varieties, just so many alliterations in a line, or alliterations
in a similar position in certain words of corresponding lines.
The following is a very good example. It is from an “Address
to the New Year,” or, more literally, “The sight of the
New Year.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>How ingenious and regular are the alliterations! This
is from a poem, written in 1847. During the present century,
rhymes have been gaining in favor greatly. A longer
meter and more perfect rhythm is also cultivated. The old
verse, and much of the more modern, is a very short meter,
which, to us, does not seem as poetical as a more stately and
majestic tread. Formerly, and sometimes at the present
day, verse was printed without capitals, except at the commencement
of a stanza. Let us see how old John Milton
looks in an Icelandic dress; and how Mr. Thorlakson
sings:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Það bar til einhvern helgidag þegar eg var eitthvað sjö vetra gamall,
að kunningjar mínir fylltu vasa mína koparskildingum. Jeg
gekk þá strax beina leið til búdar þar sem barnagull voru seld;
en á leiðinni mætti jeg dreng, sem hjelt á <em>hljóðpípu</em>, og þótti mjer
svo fallegt hljóðið í henni, að jeg bauð honum af fyrra bragði allt
fje mitt fyrir hana. Siðan fór eg heim og gekk um öll hús blásandi
á <em>hljóðpípuna</em> mína, og var hinn kátasti þó eg gjörði öllum heimamönnum
ónæði. Bræður mínir, systur, og frændur komust brátt
að um kaupskap minn, og sögðu mjer þa að eg hefði gefið fjórum
sinnum meira fyrir pípuna enn hún væri verð. Þá fór eg að hugsa
um hvað marga góða gripi eg hefði getað eignast fyrir það, sem
eptir hefði mátt vertða af skildingum minum; og þau hlóu svo
lengi að heimsku minni, að jeg grjet af gremju, og umhugsanin um
þetta hriggði mig meira enn <em>hljóðpípan</em> gladdi mig.</p>

<p class='c025'>Þetta atvik kom mjer þó síðan til nota, því áhrifin urðu eptir í
sál minni; og opt, þegar freistni kom að mjer að kaupe einhvern
óþarfann, sagði eg við sjálfan mig, <em>gefðu ei of mikið fyrir hlóðpípuna</em>;
og með því móti hjelt eg fje mínu.</p>

<p class='c025'>Þegar eg óx upp, komst út í heiminn, og fór að taka eptir breitni
manna, þá fannst mjer svo sem eg hitti marga, mjög marga, sem
<em>gáfu of mikið fyrir hljóðpípuna</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Þegar eg sá mann, af eintómri eptirsókn eptir hylli konunga,
eyða aldri sínum í því að bíða eptir hentugleikum þeirra, fórna
næði sínu, frelsi, dygð og jafnvel vinum sínum, til að ná henni, þá
sagði jeg við sjálfan mig, <em>þessi maður gefur of mikið fyrir hljóðpípu
sína</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Þegar eg sá annan mann láta mikið af alþýðu hylli, og verja

eg þá, <em>of mikið fyrir hljóðpípu sína</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Ef eg sje einhvern armingja, sem einasta til þess að geta hrúgað

ánægju, sem í því er að gjöra vel við aðra, alla virðingu segi eg þa,
<em>þjer gefið vissulega of mikið fyrir hljóðpípu yðar</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Þegar eg mæti gleðimandi, sem fórnar hverju tækifært til að
auðga sál sína eða bæta hag sinn á lofsverðan hátt, og það vegna
eintómrar holdlegrar nautnar: <em>óláns-maður</em>, segi eg þá, <em>þjer bakið
yður böl en ei gleði</em>: <em>þjer gefið of mikið fyrir hljóðpípu yðar</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Sjái jeg mann af tómri hjegómadýrð sækjast eptir dýrindis
fötum, hússgögnum og öðrum útbunaði, allt meira enn efni hans
leyfa, safna fyrir þá sök skuldum og lenda loks í díflissu; <em>æ</em>, segi eg
þá, <em>hann hefur dýrkeypt, mjög dýrkeypt, hljóðpípu sína</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Þegar eg sje fagra, blíðlynda meyju, gefna illum og hroðalegum

svona mikið fyrir eina hljóðpípu</em>.</p>

<p class='c025'>Í stuttu máli, eg komst að raun um að mikill hluti af eydum

<p class='c013'>The word <em>Hljothpipan</em>, literally translated, is a pipe, or
musical instrument, made out of a reed. These extracts
from Icelandic literature are undoubtedly very interesting!
If not so readily perused as our English, they at least show
the literary taste of the Icelanders, and something of the
variety and style of their composition. Here is an extract

<p class='c013'>A translation of this is scarcely required, as its purport
can be readily seen. It is a short article written by Mr.
Bjarni Johnson, for the T<span class='fsvs'>HIOTHOLFUR</span>, and giving an account
of the author’s visit to Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Icelandic, whole sentences from other languages are
thrown into one word. The word <em>Vesturheimsmathur</em>, fully
translated, is <em>a man who has his home on the western continent</em>.
It goes on to speak of this native of the West, as a
member of the New York Historical Society—“Sagnafjelagsins”—and
that, during a somewhat rainy period, he visited
Iceland, traveled through the interior of the country,
went to the Geyser, the little Geyser, the Sulphur Mountains—“brennisteinnámurnar”—of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Krisuvik, and climbed
to the top of Hekla. It speaks of the visit as a pleasant one,
and that on the return of the traveler to America—“Vesturheims”—he
took some books from the Iceland public library—“stiptsbókasafnith”—as
a present to the American
Smithsonian library, in return for a similar present formerly
received from Smithson’s. Then he journeyed on the mail
packet—“póstskipinu”—to the continent of Europe, after a
long tour and an agreeable stay in Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>This shall close our extracts. Lest some may think
that the writer of this volume is an enthusiast, and overrates
the value of Icelandic literature, the following statement
is quoted from the preface to the English translation
of Rask’s Icelandic Grammar, by Hon. George P. Marsh,
and shows the high estimate placed on the language and
literature of the Northmen, by this eminent linguist.</p>

<p class='c025'>The translator cannot here enter upon so copious a subject
as the character and value of the literature of Iceland; and it must
suffice to remark, that in the opinion of those most competent to
judge, it has never been surpassed, if equaled, in all that gives
value to that portion of history which consists of spirited delineations
of character, and faithful and lively pictures of events among
nations in a rude state of society.</p>

<p class='c025'>That the study of the Old-Northern tongue may have an important
bearing on English grammar and etymology, will be obvious
when it is known that the Icelandic is most closely allied to
the Anglo-Saxon, of which so few monuments are extant; and a
slight examination of its structure, and remarkable syntactical
character, will satisfy the reader, that it may well deserve the
attention of the philologist.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>T<span class='fsvs'>HE</span> Icelanders, as I have pictured them, are intellectual
in their tastes; and in domestic life they are highly social.
Their amusements are few, their enjoyments being principally
in the family, at their labor, and attending public worship.
Throughout the country, they gather from a circuit
of many miles, to hear their ministers proclaim “glad
tidings,” and tell them of the reward that awaits a well-spent
life. In the long winter evenings, one member of the
family is much of the time reading aloud, while the others
are engaged in domestic duties, spinning, weaving, knitting,
and making clothing and domestic utensils, in which
the males as well as the females, all engage. In their
personal demeanor, the Icelanders are generally quiet, sober,
and somewhat taciturn. A love of amusement, and a
fondness for sport, is not common. Some of the Icelanders
that I have seen, have had a great deal of vivacity, and
large conversational powers. Some that have visited foreign
countries, have returned home so impressed with their experience
of the great and busy world; that they have infused
a spirit of activity and inquiry into the whole circle where
they move. They tell of one man, an Icelander, who got
off to the continent, and went through all the wars of Napoleon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>and after many years returned to his native land. He
was so glad to see his own good island, that he fell down
and embraced the earth, and declared, in the words of the
national proverb, “Iceland is the best country the sun
shines upon.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> With all that the poor soldier had seen of
the luxury and variety of foreign countries, there was, to
him, “no place like home.” While the Icelander is fond
of conversation, when in the presence of strangers he
rather listen than talk. They come well up to Dr. Johnson’s
favorite character, a good listener. When a foreigner
calls at the house of an Icelander, he attends first to the
personal wants of his guest; then he is desirous of learning
all the stranger has to communicate. He is shrewd and
inquisitive, and asks the most pertinent and ingenious questions,
and never rests satisfied till he has learned with great
minuteness all that the stranger has to tell him respecting
the great world, and the foreign countries he has seen. He
is always most respectful and obliging, and ready to communicate
information, and answer questions about every
thing relating to his country or pursuits. He seems to appreciate
the greater amount of wealth and luxury abroad,
and the superior magnificence and splendor of cities like
Copenhagen, Paris, London, or New York, as compared to
his own small towns; yet his <em>amor patriæ</em> and contentment
make him superior to all temptations to emigrate. His industry,
fondness for reading and conversing, his great integrity
of character, a devotional spirit, and ardent love for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>precepts and practices of Christianity—these, with his contentment
and love of liberty, are the most prominent characteristics
of the Icelander. They do not show much fondness
for exact science, though they pay some attention to the
studies of geography and natural history. Having no fuel but
turf—except what is imported—none of the precious or useful
metals, no material, except wool, for the manufacture of
textile fabrics, raising no fruits or grain, and having little
use for water or steam power, they have few incentives to
exert themselves in acquiring a knowledge of chemistry,
mineralogy, geology, electricity, magnetism, hydraulics,
pneumatics, or many of the mechanic and useful arts.
“Circumstances make men,” or bring out certain traits of
character; and the Icelander forms no exception to the general
rule. We see how he is placed. Obtaining his subsistence
from the products of the earth and the sea, engaged
little in traffic, he does not experience much of the fraud
and wrong that is found in the busy haunts of men; and in
him we see little but the gentle and better characteristics of
our nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Icelander is poor, and books are to him a luxury;
yet he possesses more, in proportion to his means, than the
natives of any other country. We shall see by comparison
and looking at facts, what their intellectual resources are.
The number of books, of all sizes, published in Iceland in
each of the years 1847 and 1848, was seventeen—thirty-four
volumes in two years; and these for a community of
60,000 people. Were there as many in proportion printed
for our population of twenty-five millions, the number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>books—distinct works, independent of periodicals—published
annually in the United States, would be over seven
thousand. The most of the Iceland books are duodecimos
and octavos; the largest volume for the year 1847 containing
928 pages. This was a sort of “Congressional Globe,”
though not issued in numbers—a record of the proceedings
of their Althing or Congress.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a> This seems like a pretty
lengthy journal of a session that lasted but little over a
month. They passed a number of acts of much importance
to the people; and very likely the session was enlivened
with as many “speeches to Buncombe,” as we hear
in the same length of time on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the works published in Icelandic, are issued
from the press in Copenhagen; but the majority of them
are printed and bound in Iceland. They have several printing-presses
constantly at work, and three newspapers—one
once a week, and two issued once a fortnight. In mechanical
execution, their books and newspapers are turned out
in better style than the average of those issued from the
American press. They are, however, always without illustrations.</p>

<p class='c013'>From what has been said, it will be seen that the Icelanders
of the present day are a different people from those
of an earlier period. In former times, the tyranny of rulers
and the ambition of demagogues, kept up a warlike spirit,
and an ardent love of political liberty. While they were
less amiable and peaceful, they showed, both in letters and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>politics, a greater degree of activity. Lest it may be
thought that I have drawn too favorable a picture of the
early Icelanders, I will here give an extract from a learned
dissertation on the history and literature of Iceland, by the
distinguished Dr. (now Sir Henry) Holland, who visited the
country in 1810, in company with Sir George Mackenzie.</p>

<p class='c025'>Like the aurora borealis of their native sky, the poets and
historians of Iceland not only illuminated their own country, but
flashed the lights of their genius through the night which then
hung over the rest of Europe. Commerce was pursued by the inhabitants
with ardor and success; and they partook of the maritime
adventures of discovery and colonization, which gave so
much merited celebrity to the Norwegians of this period. Of the
several features which distinguish this remarkable period in the
history of Iceland, the literary character of the people is doubtless
the most extraordinary and peculiar. We require much evidence
to convince us of the fact that a nation remote from the rest
of Europe, dwelling on a soil so sterile, and beneath such inclement
skies, should have sent forth men whose genius, taste, and acquirements
did honor to their country, and to the times in which they
lived. Such evidence, however, of the most distinct and decisive
kind, we possess in the many writings which have come down from
this period to the present age, and in the testimonies afforded by
the cotemporaneous writers of other countries. The reality of the
fact, indeed, can admit of no doubt; and it is only left for us to
speculate upon the causes which led to this singular anomaly in
the history of literature.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>The above was written forty years ago, and by one of
the most intelligent travelers that ever visited Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was asked by the Icelanders, if it would not be an object
for some of my countrymen to settle in Iceland, and
teach them the practical and productive arts as understood
in my country. I told them, I did not think it would be an
object for the natives of any country I knew to go and settle
there. The restrictive laws of Denmark do not favor
trade with foreigners; the country produces too little variety,
and too small quantities of suitable articles for exportation,
to create a trade of much magnitude. Their soil is, a
majority of it, entirely unproductive; and the balance produces
too little ever to support a numerous population. The
articles they have are good of the kind; they raise excellent
beef and mutton; the wool of their sheep is soft and durable,
but not fine or handsome. It is not so good for first-class
manufactures, as the sheep are often pied, spotted,
and variegated in color; and it is not so good for coloring,
as they always pull it off of the animals, instead of shearing
it.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Fish—salmon and cod—are important articles of
export; and their horses, though small, are very desirable
animals. A little larger than the Shetland pony, often of
singular color, hardy, gentle, and docile; for pony carriages,
and for children and females to ride, I think they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>be a desirable addition to our stock of horses in the United
States. A schooner-load of them went from Iceland to
Scotland, when I was in the country; and I have no doubt
they sold at a good profit, as the average cost was less than
ten dollars a head. As these animals are never fed in
winter, they are necessarily raised very cheaply; and, were
trade open with foreign countries, I have no doubt a great
demand would spring up for them, and add largely to the
profits of the Iceland farmer. Apropos of this subject of
free trade, I will here give an extract from the letter of an
intelligent Icelander, which I have just received, and
which was written after the commencement of hostilities
in Europe. There is no reason why the king of Denmark
should not open the trade of Iceland equally to all nations.
It is not a particle of pecuniary benefit to his kingdom, as
there are no duties charged; but, by restricting the trade to
Danish vessels, it is kept as a kind of monopoly by a few
merchants of Copenhagen; while the poor Icelanders complain
greatly of the oppression and hardship of being dependent
for their foreign necessaries and luxuries, entirely on
a few grasping speculators. Whenever the Iceland Althing
passes an act opening their ports to all nations, the king
vetoes the bill. They murmur at it as great injustice; but
what avail the murmurs of the weak? During the last war
in Europe—1810&ndash;12—Denmark came near losing the colony
in two different ways. One was, the enemy came near
taking possession; and another escape they had, the
“mother country” not being able to protect the island, or
send them supplies, the people came near starving to death;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and were only saved from the greatest destitution by the
clemency and liberality of Great Britain, in treating the
Icelanders as “friends,” while the country was at war with
Denmark. If his Danish Majesty should feel compelled to
take up arms in the present struggle, the island would be in
similar peril. Respecting this, and some other subjects, the
following letter, from a learned Icelander—the President of
the Iceland College—will be read with interest:</p>
<div class='c028'><i>Reykjavik, March 1st, 1854.</i></div>

<p class='c025'>S<span class='fsvs'>IR</span>:</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c025'>As to political news, I have not much to relate; nor, I am sure,
do you expect much from this quarter; yet, a change is about to
take place in our commercial relations. In all probability, the
Danish government will, after a monopoly of two and a half centuries,
at length, this year, condescend to allow of our free intercourse,
for mercantile purposes, with all nations. It would be superfluous
to write you any thing about the impending war; but I
cannot forbear stating, that in case of war between England and
Russia, to which Denmark would probably be constrained to become
a party, our situation here, in this island, would needs become
very precarious.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c025'>Sir: I should be charmed to visit your stately country, to get an
idea of her soaring aspirations, to view her wonders of civilization,
with all her rapid improvements. She seems to be the only country
that at present enjoys the blessings of freedom, and on whose
soil liberty can prosper. But I very much fear my desire of paying a
visit there will ever remain a “<em>pium votum</em>” which neither my
financial circumstances nor my occupation will allow of.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c025'>Though you have, dear sir, already rendered me
so many important services, I must, before concluding this letter,
once more importune you with a boon, which is in the interest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>my college, to procure me a copy of the following work, a most
excellent one, by one of your countrymen—“Report on Education
in Europe, to the Trustees of the Girard College for Orphans, by
Alex. Dallas Bache, Philadelphia, 1839.” I have made several applications
to my bookseller in Copenhagen, but all in vain. Then,
I should feel much obliged to you, if you could procure me, by
the means of your influential friends in America and Great Britain,
some examination papers from some of your colleges or schools of
England, especially from Eton, Harrow, or Winchester, containing
the questions put to the pupils, as well as copies of the best answers
to them; together with specimens of their exercises in Latin
and Greek. If you could comply with this desire of mine, you
would render yourself one of the benefactors of our college. I
could send the expense to Mr. Younghusband, your correspondent
in Liverpool.</p>

If the Danish government should open the ports of Iceland
to all nations, it would be in accordance with the advanced
and progressive spirit of the age, and while conferring a
great benefit on a quiet, peaceful, and isolated colony, knit
more closely the ties of affection and union between the colonists

Denmark, that a law has just been passed, throwing open the ports
of Iceland to the trade of the world. For this, none will rejoice
more than the Icelanders themselves; for a more relentless, grinding,
and hated monopoly never oppressed a poor people. The
resident Danish merchants will now not be able to have every
thing their own way. As the law takes effect in April, 1855, a
trade between Iceland and England, and Iceland and America, will
soon spring up. The articles that the Icelanders most require from
foreign countries, and the productions of the island which they
have to export, will be found enumerated in preceding chapters.</p>

    <div>RAMBLES BROUGHT TO A CLOSE—EMBARKATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>T<span class='fsvs'>HOUGH</span> this little book was not written for the Iceland
market, I cannot help making one or two remarks respecting
their own internal affairs. Most undoubtedly they have
learned more from experience than a foreigner from a hasty
visit could teach them, but I believe they do not appreciate
the productiveness and value of their soil. As scanty as are
the agricultural resources of Iceland, and as short as their
seasons are, I am confident that this “art of arts” might be
greatly advanced here. Plowing would, certainly, in many
places, greatly improve their land, smooth the surface, and
enable them to lay it down with a better quality of grass.
Their seed would, the most of it, however, have to be brought
from foreign countries. On seeing their fine meadows of
“red top”—the kind of grass most prevalent,—I at once
told them that the white, if not the red clover, would be
much more productive than their native grasses. Afterwards,
I saw many farms in the valleys of the Laxá and the
Thiorsá rivers, that were well seeded with white clover; and
as it was the haying season, I could see that these farms
yielded about double the hay that other farms did, where
there was no clover. The clover had once been sown, and
then it had propagated itself. I believe many of the more
favorably located farms could be made to produce barley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and oats, if the land were properly prepared. These grains
are raised in Orkney, Shetland, and the Faroe Isles; and the
latter group is but little south of Iceland. Nothing would
do, however, without plowing; and in Iceland never a horse
wore harness yet, so it would take a little time to get such
a business started. If the governor of Iceland were a thoroughly
practical man, he could do much towards introducing
these and other improvements. A good opening
place for the plow would be the “public square” in Reykjavik,
about two acres of irregular grass; that, once broken
up, and leveled, and seeded down to white clover, would
make a beautiful village green. If they had plows, they
would make larger gardens than they now do with the
spade, and more table vegetables would be raised. This
would be conducive to the health and comfort of the people,
and would, probably, in time, if not entirely eradicate at
least greatly reduce the diseases of the skin, and that terrible
plague, the leprosy; both of which are somewhat common,
and undoubtedly produced, or greatly aggravated, by living
to a great extent on animal food.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Icelanders, like all other ancient people, are extremely
attached to their own customs, and averse to innovation.
I noticed one thing here, that—though, as Captain
Cuttle would say, there was not much wisdom in it—is characteristic
of every people under the sun. While fond of
every foreign article, particularly of ornament, they about
entirely neglected the native productions. With great pains
and trouble, they would rear in their houses, geraniums,
roses, fuchsias, violets, and other exotics, and yet neglect to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>plant one single native flower. The beautiful and fragrant
heath, common over much of Iceland, does not grow within
several miles of Reykjavik; and yet not one single resident
had planted by his dwelling a stalk of this elegant little
shrub, to bloom and give out perpetual fragrance. I saw,
also, beautiful annual flowers growing wild in the fields, and
on the river banks, but which were never cultivated. Sir
George Mackenzie has given a list of the Iceland Flora, and
a pretty long catalogue it is.</p>

<p class='c013'>I believe a carriage road could be made in some places,
particularly between Reykjavik and Hafnarfiorth; but then
it might not pay to attempt to make many carriage roads,
and introduce wheeled vehicles in Iceland. If the land was
leveled and seeded down, and bogs and wet places drained,
and converted into dry, productive meadows, I believe it
would be an object for the larger farmers to have carts to
draw their hay on, rather than carry it in bundles on the
backs of men or horses. Then, too, if their meadows were
smooth the product would be much greater, and they would
be able to introduce a much larger scythe than the little
two-foot knife-blade affair used there at present. With the
improvement of their land, their tools could be greatly improved.
The population of Iceland has been stated at
60,000 souls, and probably the increase is not one-and-a-half
per cent. annually. Women, as well as men, work in the
fields, during the hay season; but, in fishing, the men only
are engaged. The exposure attendant on this latter business
gives many complaints of the lungs; and probably more
die of consumption than of any other disease. The plague,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>about five hundred years ago, visited Iceland; but cholera
and yellow fever have never been here. There are but few
physicians in the country, and the distances they have to
travel often make their services of no avail, Death calling
on the patient before the doctor does. In countries of more
luxury and refinement, Death often calls soon after the doctor!
From what I learn, I should judge longevity was not
as great here as in most countries in the temperate zones.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last Sunday I was in Iceland I attended church at
the Reykjavik cathedral. This is a beautiful little edifice,
of brick, with a fine altar—altogether of an ornamental appearance.
The sermon was in Icelandic, the service Lutheran,
but much after the style of the Church of England.
Three Sundays out of four, I think it is, that the service in
this place is in Icelandic, and every fourth Sunday in Danish.
What the use may be of having any service in Danish is
more than I can tell, for a more worldly, ungodly set than
the Danish merchants of Iceland I never saw in a Christian
country. At this place, their example has driven nearly all
religious observances away from the Icelanders. Though
the day was beautiful, and but one church in the village, and
all professing the same religion, and all the people, too, understanding
both languages, there were not, from among the
twelve hundred people of the place, fifty worshipers. This
certainly does not accord with what I have said of the moral
and religious habits of the Icelanders in general. I do not
think I do the Danes injustice, when I lay the immorality in
and around Reykjavik to their influence and example. In
several villages and country places I had a good opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>of observing, and I know that ten times greater proportion
of the people attended church than here in Reykjavik. A
class like these merchants, who notoriously do nothing but
traffic, make money, gamble, and drink, cannot improve the
morals of a simple, pious, and intellectual people.</p>

<p class='c013'>The people assembled at the church very quietly, and
took their seats without tarrying at the door, or entering
into conversation. They were all dressed neatly, and two
or three females wore the ancient costume of the country.
It is very picturesque, but</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot do better than give another extract from the

date of March 1st, 1854, as well as part of one written the
November previous. Only a portion of the letters are given,
and all of this is of a private and personal nature, intended
for no eye but my own. Barring the compliments that are
given, the extracts will be read with interest, both as showing
the composition of an Icelander in a foreign language,
and the educational, parochial, and local news communicated.
Commencing his letter of March 1st, he says:</p>

<p class='c025'>“M<span class='fsvs'>Y</span> D<span class='fsvs'>EAR</span> S<span class='fsvs'>IR</span>!</p>

<p class='c025'>“I have to acknowledge from you the third letter since we parted—of
Dec. 4th, last (Washington)—together with a large parcel of
books, all sent to me by the care of your friend Mr. Younghusband,
at Liverpool, who, besides, had the kindness to write me a
very friendly letter, and send me the last copies of the leading
newspapers of Great Britain.—Indeed, sir, I feel quite ashamed at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>receiving so many proofs of your friendship, without being capable
of giving you the least mark of my gratitude; for all I can furnish
is our little “Þjoðolfur,”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> a poor return for all your liberality. To
this I take the liberty to add an examination paper—(Program<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a>)—in
Icelandic and Danish—of the management and teaching of our
College, for the year 1852, ’53.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c025'>I have forwarded
all your presents to the persons interested that are living here in
town and neighborhood: such as were destined for the interior of
the country, I must keep till the spring, all communication therewith
being impracticable except on foot. Now I am charged with
the task of bringing you their thanks, for your kindness in remembering
them when you had so little to thank for. I left your direction
with them, intimating that a letter from them would be much
esteemed by you, even though written in Danish or Icelandic.
And as to news concerning your acquaintances here, all is unchanged.
None of the ladies you mention, are married. The Misses
Johnson are keeping a female school pretty successfully; the Misses
Sivertsen living with their parents, and I am to tell you the compliment
of their father.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> He has delivered to me the flask you so
kindly presented me with, and which I shall keep as a souvenir of
you, though rather too small for my capacious stomach! The
Dean Johnson is going to leave in March, to the regret of his
friends. He is to have another living in the interior of the country.
Thorarensen has left the College, and you will find his name (S.
Thorarensen) as well as that of Jon Sveinson in the examination
paper I send you here inclosed. Mrs. Egilson,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Mr. Ranthrys, the

pleased with the <em>N. Y. Illustrated News</em> you sent them. I have
also to salute you from the Bishop.”</p>
<p class='c013'>In Mr. Johnson’s letter of Nov. 15th, 1853, he says:</p>
<p class='c025'>“I have to acknowledge from you the reception of two letters;
the former of Sept. 24, 1852 (Glasgow), the latter of Sept. 5, this
year (Washington), both attended with newspapers, for which I
feel very much obliged to you, as for your friendship in general.
I am very glad to learn by your latter letter, that you are returned
sound and safe to your native country, from your long and checkered
journey. But I trust you will not repent the toils and hardships
inseparably connected with such a ‘tour’ almost around the
world. You will, I am sure, allow of its important consequences
for our own mental improvement and development. Old Horace
says: ‘<em>Qui multorum providus urbes et mores hominum inspexit—latumque
per æquor, aspera multa pertulit adversis rerum immersabilis
undis</em>.’</p>

<p class='c025'>“I am very much indebted to you for the copies of newspapers
you so kindly have sent to me. However, I deeply regret none
of them contained your lectures upon the curiosities of this country,
as in general what attracted your notice on your extensive
journey. But then I console myself by your kind promise to send
me a copy of your Travels in Iceland, when ready from the press.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c025'>I have to announce to you Jon Sveinson’s most
heartfelt thanks for your letter of introduction to your friend at
Hull,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> which benefited him very much during his stay there; and
I feel obliged to join my thanks to his, as it was on my recommendation
that you gave him the said letter. Indeed, sir, he feels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>very much bound in gratitude to you and your friends for all the
kindness they poured on him. He has now left the college—last
season—with a very honorable testimonial; and but for the cholera
that has been raging in Denmark during the latter part of the
last summer, he would have gone to the University of Copenhagen;
but now having postponed his journey thither to the next spring,
he passes this winter at his father’s, who is a reputed clergyman of
easy circumstances, in the interior of this country. Jon Sveinson’s
visit to Hull, has also procured me a friend there. The last summer,
I had successively received some copies of English newspapers,
without knowing from what quarter they came. I thought
of you or some of my other friends in Great Britain; but a couple
of months ago I received a letter from Mr. Archibald Kidd, Saville
street, Hull (if I decipher his name correctly), who informed me
that it was to him I was indebted for the favor of the newspapers,
and who asked me some information about the means of studying
Icelandic literature, and the method of setting out about it. I
most readily complied with his request, as far as I could, and
wrote him by the last post-ship for Liverpool. As he intimated to
know you, I expect you to be so kind as to give me in your next
letter some information about this gentleman.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c025'>I send
you enclosed a copy of the <em>Thiotholfur</em> for the whole year 1852&ndash;53.
I wish you to tell me whether I am to continue it. This I might
easily do, especially in the summer time, as at that season there
are frequent occasions for sending to England; whereas, in winter
it is more difficult, the only ship going there being the post-ship,
and my extensive official correspondence with the ministry of public
instruction seldom permitting me sufficient leisure to write to
my private friends.</p>

<p class='c025'>“Now, I wish these lines may find you in good health and happiness;
and I sign myself, my dear sir,</p>

coming, as he does partly up to Shakspeare’s description
of Cardinal Wolsey—“a man of an unbounded stomach.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In closing my account of the Icelanders at Reykjavik, I
have to record the pleasure and profit that I derived from
the friendly attentions of these excellent people. I spent
many and most pleasant hours with President Johnson, and
with Mr. Sivertsen and his wife and daughters; also a most
agreeable evening at the house of the Dean, Rev. Mr. Johnson,
who made a small party on my account. The young
ladies in this family, as also in Mr. Sivertsen’s, and Mr. Ranthry’s,
contributed much to the agreeable socialities of my
stay in Reykjavik. Were these fair daughters of the North
to appear in society in England or America, a comparison
to their disadvantage could not be drawn. Speaking several
languages—always two or more—good players on the
pianoforte and the guitar, skilled also in vocal music, and
to these accomplishments, add a knowledge of household
duties, and I fear that many of the graduates of our female
boarding-schools could not successfully come into competition
with them. I also partook of the hospitalities of their
most excellent bishop, who lives a little way out of town, on
a pleasant part of the coast, opposite the island of Vithey.
Before leaving Copenhagen, and on my return there, I
formed a most agreeable acqaintance with Mr. Gisli Brinjulfsson,
quite a young man, but already enjoying a good
literary reputation, both in his own country and in Denmark.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>He is a graduate of the Iceland College, and edited
for two successive years the “N<span class='fsvs'>ORTHURFARI</span>,”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a>—an Iceland
“Annual.” This volume gives a <em>résumé</em> of the political
news of the world for the year previous, together with tales,
original poetry, and many interesting translations from English
and American writers. But the time of my departure
from the country, arrives and these jottings must close. As
the vessel prepared to sail, several of my Iceland friends
came to see me off, and wish me a pleasant journey. As I
took their parting hands, I could not but think that this, in
all human probability, was our last meeting on earth. Promises
to write and send newspapers were mutually interchanged.
The booming gun echoes o’er the broad waters—the
sail is set—the mountains fast disappearing in the distance,
and the shores of Iceland grow dim on my sight.
The little ship with the wandering pilgrim goes dancing
over the waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>A <span class='fsvs'>FINE</span> morning in August found our little schooner
dancing over the waves of the Greenland strait. Towering
up on our right, was the lofty Snæfell Jokull, one of the
highest mountains in Iceland. It has the regular conical
shape of most volcanoes. It is six thousand feet high, being
one-third higher than Vesuvius. At this season about
two-thirds of its height is black, and the rest is covered with
perpetual snow. When more than fifty miles to the south,
I took a drawing of it. It is near the end of a long peninsula,
south of Breithifiorth, and very nearly the westernmost
point of Iceland. The sharp outline of the mountain is distinctly
visible in the clear atmosphere here for more than a
hundred miles. This volcano has not had an eruption for
several centuries. Two or three parties of modern travelers
have been to the summit. They have described the ascent,
after reaching the snow-line, as extremely dangerous. Wide
and deep cracks in the everlasting ice, and treacherous
bridges of snow, made the danger so great that they tied
themselves in a string, to a long rope, and walked about six
feet apart. Then, if one man fell through into a chasm, the
rest pulled him out. No lives were lost, however, in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>excursions; the toil sweetened the pleasure, the danger
spiced it, and they were much gratified with their lofty journey.
To the east of Snæfell Jokull, we sailed by Stapi, a
small town near some famous basaltic cliffs, on the coast.
Immense perpendicular columns, and many thrown down,
give the coast much the appearance of the vicinity of the
Giant’s Causeway, and the island of Staffa. The coast here
is more varied, and the scenery more magnificent, than the
north of Ireland; but there is no cave yet discovered
that will vie with the famed one of Fingal’s. Some of the
pillars here at Stapi are near eight feet in diameter,
and all of them of the regular geometrical shape so often
seen in basaltic rocks. They are like the cells in honeycombs,
but solid, and generally hexagonal, but sometimes
heptagons and pentagons. Though the time when these
basalts were in a state of fusion is very remote, yet there is
no doubt of their volcanic character. If geologists and mineralogists
wish to see volcanic matter in every variety of
form, let them come to Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>We passed by the Meal Sack and the Grenadier Islands,
the first day, and rounded the long nose of Cape Reykjanes,
and the second found us driving before a southwest wind;
due east, along the south coast of Iceland. We sailed near
the Westmann Islands, and plainly in sight of the lofty summits
of Hekla, Torfa, Eyjafjalla, and Tindfjalla Jokulls.
The most singular curiosity on the south coast of Iceland,
that can be seen from the sea, is a group of rocks that I
should call <em>The Needles</em>, from their great resemblance to the
“Needles” of the Isle of Wight. They are near a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>fishing village called Dyarholar, or “Portland.” The rocks
are shaped a little more like bodkins than needles, and some
of them rear their pointed heads near a hundred feet high.
They all stand in the ocean, some of them over a mile from
land. As we sailed east, the craggy summit of the Oræfa
Jokull showed his lofty and chilly head. The sides, too,
were visible as well as the summit, and perpendicular rocks
and dark-looking caverns showed the foot-prints of mighty
convulsions of nature. The Oræfa Jokull, forming part of
that immense mountain known as Skaptar Jokull, is, as I
have mentioned before, the highest in Iceland. By trigonometrical
measurement, it is 6,760 feet high. Snæfell Jokull
is 6,000 feet; Eyjafjalla Jokull, 5,900; and Hekla,
5,700. The Thiorsá river, a stream larger than the Hudson
or the Rhine, rises high up on the side of Skaptar Jokull,
3,000 feet above the level of the sea, and in a deep cañon
in the lava, pours its resistless torrent down into the ocean.
Its rapid and turbulent current may be imagined. These
mountains in the interior of the country, the volcanic islands
out at sea, the rapid and powerful rivers, the Geysers, and
innumerable hot springs, along with the magnificent coast
scenery, form the most prominent physical features of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c013'>For two days we were skirting the island on the south
coast. This, and the eastern part of Iceland, has few harbors.
The coast is, much of it, low and sandy, and difficult
of approach. Some years since, a French vessel was
wrecked here in the winter season, and the crew cast ashore,
perfectly destitute. A few poor Icelanders that lived in the
vicinity, carried them to their huts, fed and took care of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>and gave them shelter till spring. The next summer, on the
annual return of the French war-vessel that visits Iceland,
the sailors were taken home; and king Louis Philippe
ordered a handsome compensation and reward in money, to
the Icelanders who had so hospitably protected his shipwrecked
sailors. They, however, did not wish it; said they
had only done their duty, and neither wanted nor deserved
compensation; and steadily refused to accept a single penny.
Determined to do something in return for their kindness,
Louis Philippe ordered his representative in Iceland to state
that he would educate at the University of France, four
young Icelanders; and the Governor, the Bishop, and the
President of the College, made choice of the young men who
were to be recipients of the favor. At the end of their term—four
years—as many more were selected; and thus the
French government undertook the constant care and expense
of the education of four Iceland boys, who were appointed
for their ability, diligence, and good conduct, to
receive the bounty of the French government; and all for
an act of humanity towards a crew of shipwrecked sailors.
The whole transaction reflects the highest honor on all concerned.
One of the young gentlemen who was a recipient
of this privilege, was a son of my friend Mr. Sivertsen. After
the French war-vessel, the unfortunate L<span class='fsvs'>ILLOISE</span>, was
lost, or failed to return from the Arctic sea, in connection
with one of the expeditions that went in search of her, there
was a scientific corps—a “Scandinavian Commission”—organized,
of learned men from France, Denmark, and Iceland,
to gather information, make drawings of landscapes, and collect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>specimens of mineralogy, botany, and the various
branches of natural history. The commission was headed
by M. Paul Geimar, and our young Icelander was one of
the party. The results of the expedition, in a scientific point
of view, were of the highest value. A work was published,
containing several folio volumes of plates, many of them colored,
and the Journal of the Expedition, in six octavos; and
altogether it forms the most valuable work of the kind extant.
It comprises Iceland, Greenland, Lapland, and Spitzbergen;
and nothing, either of a geographical, scientific, or
historical nature has been omitted. Along with portraits
of Geimar and others of the Commission, is a “counterfeit
presentment” of young Sivertsen; and his is one of the
finest faces ever delineated. It has the lively, intelligent
countenance, lofty brow, and beaming eye of the Anglo-Saxons,
and equal to the finest specimens of the Caucasian
race in any part of the world. This promising young man
died in France, a few years after his return from the North,
universally esteemed by all, and by none more than by
Louis Philippe himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the winds are drifting us lazily to the eastward.
We sailed north of Faroe, and saw the cliffs of the lofty
Stromoe towering upwards like the ruins of some gigantic
temple. The return voyage was all beautiful September
weather. Our passengers—except the bachelor of the present
writing—consisted of twelve young Iceland ladies, and
a small lad; and we had a regular “jolly” time. Several
of the young ladies were singers, and two of them had
guitars. Nearly every afternoon we had a dance. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>young ladies made fast progress in English—and Yankee—manners,
customs, language, <em>and</em> dancing. I also got well
posted up in Icelandic, particularly in the sentimental,—or,
as Sam Weller would say, in the more “tenderer vords.”
Guitar music, Iceland hymns, the violin, and “threading the
dance” on a rocking deck, were all matters of every-day
occurrence. Did I say every day? Not with me. But
the master of the Sölöven, Captain Heinrich Stilhoff, was
certainly the most reckless, irreligious man for a sea-captain,
that ever I saw in my life. Had a sober traveler come
alongside of us on Sunday, he would have been bothered
to have found out what kind of worship we had aboard.
His reflections would probably have been like old Lambro’s,
when he returned, from his piratical cruise, to his island and
his daughter. Suppose such a one in his yacht had come
up with us:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Christian he, and as our ship he nears,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He looks aboard, and finds no signs of idling,</div>
      <div class='line'>He hears—alas! no music of the spheres,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But an unhallowed, earthly sound of fiddling!</div>
      <div class='line'>A melody which makes him doubt his ears,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The cause being past his guessing or unriddling:</div>
      <div class='line'>But, lo! it is the sailors all a prancing,</div>
      <div class='line'>The women, too, and Captain Stilhoff, dancing!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It does not speak well for the Danish people and nation,
that their mail-ship, the only government vessel running
between Denmark and Iceland, is commanded by a man of
the character of Captain Stilhoff; and I cannot think it
will long continue so. Commanding a vessel carrying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Government dispatches, and having the most popular and
direct passenger traffic between the two countries, a profligate
who openly boasts of debauching his female passengers,
defenseless women, the sisters and daughters of the
citizens of both countries; a state of things that certainly
does not reflect any honor on the proprietors of the vessel,
or show much sagacity in their choice of a commander.</p>

<p class='c013'>On, on, goes our little bark; the northern shore</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Fades o’er the waters blue;</div>
      <div class='line'>The night winds sigh, the breakers roar,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And shrieks the wild sea-mew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Old Norway’s coast appears, and we are several days in
sight of the brown and snowy mountains, and little villages
of wooden houses. The thirteenth day, we passed Cape
Lindesness, and Christiansand. We were then within two
hundred and fifty miles of Copenhagen—only a few hours’
voyage for a steamship; but we had no steam a-board, except
what might be found in certain kettles and casks, and
these did not aid our progress much. I thought two days,
at farthest would suffice for the rest of our voyage; but Boreas
was not in the ascendant, nor any of his brethren
either, much, for we had very little wind from any quarter.
The current in the Skager Rack took us outwardly about
two miles an hour, and the wind was southeasterly, and we
were bound in. One tack would throw us near the coast of
Norway, and the next brought us along the low, flat sands
of Jutland. We progressed from twenty-five to fifty miles
a day. Several huge steamers boomed past us, with their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>black sides, and volumes of smoke, and swift progress.
Some of them were bound into the Baltic, and some out,
and some to Norwegian ports. At last we rounded the
Skagen Horn, and entered the Cattegat. Finally, the towers
of Elsinore Castle appeared; and, a breeze springing
up from the north, we dropped anchor before Copenhagen,
the twentieth day after leaving Iceland; and,
in a most terrible rain—so anxious were we to tread the
land again—all the passengers were set on the quay, and
found lodgings amid the turmoil of a great city.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
